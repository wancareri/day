#     scripts/ci/scaffold-check.sh [path/to/day] [<platform-toolkit>]
#
# `day new app` is the CLI's largest single output and nothing else in CI runs it end to end: it
# writes Day.toml, the sample sources, a website/, and then per locale a resource/locales/<tag>/
# catalog, a store/<tag>/ listing, an Xcode knownRegions entry and a site.toml locales row. Those
# four surfaces have to agree, and `day lint` is what checks that they do — so a scaffold that
# lints clean is the cheapest proof the whole `day new` → `day localize add` path still works.
#
# With a combo argument the check keeps going: `day pack` builds the scaffold into a release
# artifact, `day rebuild --from-dir` packs the same tree again from a scratch copy and compares
# the two (§20.3 — the scaffold is not in git, which is exactly what --from-dir is for), and on a
# desktop combo the smoke dayscript then drives the REBUILT copy and must leave its screenshot
# behind. Without a combo the check stops after the lint, as it always did.
#
# The locale list is the one daysite's CI scaffolds with (daysite/.github/workflows/ci.yml), which
# is what the language picker there renders. `en` is the template's own default and is left out on
# purpose: passing en-US would stand up a second en-US/ tree beside en/.

# …and clippy-clean, on the same reasoning: a user's first `cargo clippy` should be quiet, and
# every app scaffolded from this template runs nearly this command in its own CI — the shared
# `dayapp` preflight is `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Without
# this gate the template's lints are found by the GENERATED repositories rather than here, which
# is how `tr(*k)` (an explicit deref clippy does for you) reached Day-Rise's preflight.
#
# `--features mock` where that preflight passes none. The scaffold now declares `default =
# ["mock"]`, so this is the same backend the default would have selected and the flag is
# redundant — kept explicit because it is what makes this command work on every host regardless
# of that default. With NO backend the `day` facade has no `launch`, which is fine on Linux, where
# the entry macro expands to nothing, and a `cannot find function launch` error on macOS, where it
# does not. The app's own code is backend-independent, so the lints are the same either way.
#
# Exactly one backend, note — `mock` and a real one together trip day's `enable exactly one
# backend feature`, which is why the scratch-app BUILD in ci.yml pairs its `--features` with
# `--no-default-features`.
#
# It compiles the framework, which the pack stage below then reuses from the same target dir, so
# the real added cost is the lint pass rather than a second build.
