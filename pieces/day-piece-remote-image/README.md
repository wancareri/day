# day-piece-remote-image

Show images that arrive as bytes.

Hand the piece encoded PNG or JPEG data through a signal and it decodes and draws the
image natively, showing a placeholder until the bytes turn up. It does no networking on
purpose — fetch and cache however your app prefers, then pass the result along.

Pieces are Day's reusable UI components, shipped as ordinary crates: one Rust API in
front, a real native control per platform behind it. Enable the backends you build for
with cargo features, and `day build` wires up the native side automatically.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
