# day-piece-media

Play video in a Day app with the platform's own player.

`AVPlayerView` on macOS, `AVPlayerViewController` on iOS, `QMediaPlayer` with a
`QVideoWidget` on Qt, and ExoPlayer-backed playback on Android — play, pause, and seek
from one Rust API, with the platform handling decoding and controls.

Pieces are Day's reusable UI components, shipped as ordinary crates: one Rust API in
front, a real native control per platform behind it. Enable the backends you build for
with cargo features, and `day build` wires up the native side automatically.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
