# day-piece-pullrefresh

Pull-to-refresh for any Day scrollable — `scroll(...)` or `list(...)` — modeled on SwiftUI's
`refreshable(action:)`:

```rust
let refreshing = Signal::new(false);
pull_to_refresh(refreshing, scroll(rows))
    .on_refresh(move || {
        let done = refreshing.setter();
        std::thread::spawn(move || { reload(); done.set(false); });
    })
```

**Native** where the toolkit has a real implementation — `UIRefreshControl` (iOS), AndroidX
`SwipeRefreshLayout` (Android, added to the app's Gradle build automatically), `ARKUI_NODE_REFRESH`
(HarmonyOS) — and **emulated** elsewhere: a spinner overlay driven by the two-way `refreshing`
signal, with the pull gesture detected from AppKit's elastic scrolling and GTK's `edge-overshot`
signal (Qt/XAML: overlay + programmatic). `support()` reports the compiled tier. Scriptable on
every backend through dayscript's existing `toggle:` step.

Also the reference **container piece**: the first external Day Piece whose native view hosts a Day
child (docs/extending.md §5 — the `cx.native` + fill-layout + `cx.under` recipe).

Docs: `docs/pullrefresh.md`. Demos: the showcase's Refresh page (plain scroll) and List page
(recycling list).

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
