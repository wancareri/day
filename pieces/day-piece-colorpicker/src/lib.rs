//! day-piece-colorpicker — a color chooser bound two-way to a `Signal<Color>`, in two idioms
//! (docs/colorpicker.md; DESIGN.md §15 tier 1+shim).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let tint = Signal::new(Color::hex(0xE86A3C));
//! row((
//!     vector(gv::nav_animation).tint(move || tint.get()).frame(28.0, 28.0),
//!     color_picker(tint).alpha(true),              // the platform's chooser where there is one
//!     color_picker(tint).composed(),               // Day's own panel, identical everywhere
//! ))
//! ```
//!
//! Both idioms give the app the same control — a **color well**: a swatch showing the current
//! color that opens a chooser when pressed. They differ only in who draws the chooser.
//!
//! - [`PickerIdiom::Native`] realizes a native leaf: `NSColorWell` onto the shared
//!   `NSColorPanel`, `UIColorWell` onto the iOS color picker, `GtkColorDialogButton`, a swatch
//!   button onto `QColorDialog`, the XAML `ColorPicker` in a button flyout, and
//!   `<input type="color">`. Each is the system chooser, chrome and all.
//! - [`PickerIdiom::Composed`] builds the whole thing out of ordinary Day pieces: a drawn swatch
//!   opening an [`unrouted`](day_pieces::Cover::unrouted) [`cover`] that holds a canvas
//!   saturation/brightness field, a hue strip, an opacity strip and a preset palette. Every part
//!   of it is Rust that already runs everywhere, so it is the same picker on all nine targets.
//!
//! [`PickerIdiom::Automatic`] — the default — is `Native` where the toolkit has a chooser and
//! `Composed` where it does not. Two toolkits have none at any layer: Android ships no color
//! picker in the framework, in Material, or in AndroidX, and HarmonyOS has none in ArkTS or in the
//! ArkUI NDK. Rather than each of those growing a hand-written dialog in its own language, they
//! get the composed panel — which is also why an app that wants ONE picker everywhere can just ask
//! for it.
//!
//! The value is Day's ordinary [`Color`], so the same signal drives `.tint(…)`, `.background(…)`,
//! a canvas fill or a gradient stop with no conversion — see [docs/color.md](../color/) for what
//! that currency does and does not carry across from a native pick.
//!
//! The native leaf also accepts `Event::TextChanged` carrying any form [`Color::parse`] reads
//! (`"#e86a3c"`, `"#e86a3c80"`, `"0.91 0.42 0.24 1"`) as a synthetic pick, so dayscript's `input:`
//! step drives it on every backend.
