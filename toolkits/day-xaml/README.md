# day-xaml

Day's Windows backend: the interface is built from Windows' own XAML controls.

Pieces become real `TextBlock`, `Button`, `ToggleSwitch`, and `Slider` controls, hosted in
a normal Win32 window through XAML Islands and driven through
[`day-xaml-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/day-xaml-sys), a C++/WinRT shim. Because these
controls ship with Windows itself, a packaged Day app needs no separate runtime installer.
This is the backend behind the `windows-xaml` target.

You don't add this crate to a project yourself. Backends are chosen by a cargo feature on
[`day`](https://crates.io/crates/day) — each app binary contains exactly one — and the
`day` CLI selects the right one for the target you're building.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
