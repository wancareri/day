//! day-xaml-sys C++/WinRT XAML-Islands shim. `Handle = WinHandle(*mut UIElement)`; every Day
//! node is a real `Windows.UI.Xaml` control (TextBlock, Button, ToggleSwitch, Slider, TextBox,
//! ComboBox) hosted inside a `DesktopWindowXamlSource`. Day owns layout — containers are XAML
//! `Canvas`es and children are placed by absolute frame — exactly like the GTK/AppKit/Qt

//! id-keyed callbacks into Day's event sink.

//
// Only the rows the viewport SHOWS are realized, which is the promise `list` makes over `each`
// (docs/list.md: "builds only the rows the native widget currently shows"). A cell is created
// and bound the first time its row scrolls into the window, and the ScrollViewer's ViewChanged
// brings the next ones in; the content Canvas is sized to the whole extent from the start, so
// the scrollbar tells the truth about a set nothing has built yet. Building every row instead
// is what a ten-thousand-row query cost before: ten thousand WinRT elements and ten thousand
// row layouts, on the UI thread, before the first paint.
//
// Cell index stays == row index for the cell's whole life, so nothing about selection, the
