# day-tweak-tooltip

Give any Day piece a native help tooltip: `.tooltip("Save your changes (⌘S)")` on any
`button(...)`, `label(...)`, or other piece. It shows on hover on macOS and GTK, and on
long-press on Android.

The interesting part is the three access tiers behind one modifier: objc2 (`NSView.setToolTip:`),
gtk4-rs (`GtkWidget.set_tooltip_text`), and JNI (`View.setTooltipText`). On every other toolkit
`.tooltip(...)` quietly does nothing, so your app code stays free of platform checks.

Tweaks are Day's smallest kind of extension: a little crate that adjusts the native widget
behind a built-in piece. This one is a good mid-size example — one modifier, three native APIs,
no companion C++ shim.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
