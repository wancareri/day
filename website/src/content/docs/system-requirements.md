Every Day app builds from one Rust toolchain plus the SDK of whichever platform you target. This
page lists what each development host needs, and what each target adds on top. Where an official
installer or guide exists, this page links to it, because those instructions change and theirs
is the copy that stays current.

## Check with day doctor

`day doctor` probes this host and prints what is present, what is missing, and the command that
fixes each miss. Everything below is a written-out version of the same checks.

```bash
day doctor                       # every toolkit buildable on this host
day doctor --toolkit android     # focus one toolkit, with full setup instructions
```

Bare `day doctor` treats a missing toolkit as a warning and exits 0, because you only need the
toolkits you build for. Naming a toolkit with `--toolkit` turns its misses into errors and prints
that toolkit's setup text. For a full check, `day checkup` scaffolds a throwaway app and builds
(and packs) it for each target; see [CLI & projects](/docs/cli).

## Every host

| What | Version | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | 1.89 or newer | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| The `day` CLI | current release | [Getting started](/docs/getting-started) |
| Git | any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

Install Rust through **rustup**, not Homebrew or a distro package. Cross-compiled targets (iOS,
Android, HarmonyOS, and the web) need rustup's per-target standard library, which a system rustc
does not carry. `rustup update stable` keeps you current.

Nothing else is universal. The rest depends on which targets you build.

## Which targets build on which host

| Target | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| `macos-appkit` | ✅ | — | — |
| `ios-uikit` | ✅ | — | — |
| `windows-xaml` | — | — | ✅ |
| `linux-gtk` / `windows-gtk` / `macos-gtk` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `linux-qt` / `windows-qt` / `macos-qt` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `android-mdc` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `harmony-arkui` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `web-dom` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Apple's toolkits build only on macOS, and XAML only on Windows, because both compile against SDKs
that ship with the host OS. GTK and Qt are portable, so a macOS or Windows machine can build and
run them for development even though you ship `linux-gtk` and `linux-qt`.

## macOS

Day pins no minimum macOS version of its own. The binding constraint is Xcode: install the newest
version your macOS supports, and check
[Apple's minimum requirements](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/) if you are on an older
release. Continuous integration builds on the current `macos-latest` runner (Apple silicon).

**Command-line tools** cover `macos-appkit`, and are enough for the GTK, Qt, Android, and web
targets too:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Full Xcode** ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)) is required for
`ios-uikit`, whose build runs through `xcodebuild`. Point the command-line tools at it once
installed:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

A scaffolded app carries `platform/macos/DayApp.xcodeproj`, and `macos-appkit` builds through
`xcodebuild`, so it wants full Xcode too. (An app that predates the scaffold adopts it with
`day app add-toolkit macos-appkit`.)

**[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)** provides the rest:

```bash
brew install gtk4 libadwaita pkg-config    # macos-gtk
brew install qt pkg-config                 # macos-qt
brew install openjdk@21                    # android-mdc
brew install qemu                          # the HarmonyOS emulator
```

Swift is needed only when a dependency embeds SwiftUI ([SwiftUI embedding](/docs/guide-swiftui));
Xcode and the command-line tools both provide it.

## Windows

**Windows 10 or 11.** The `windows-xaml` target uses the XAML that ships inside those releases
rather than WinUI 3, so there is no framework runtime for you or your users to install. See the
[Windows platform page](/docs/platforms/windows-xaml) for what that means in practice.

For `windows-xaml`, install the
[Visual Studio 2022 C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (MSVC plus the
Windows 10/11 SDK) and the MSVC Rust toolchain:

```powershell
rustup default stable-msvc
```

For `windows-qt` and `windows-gtk`, install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) and build with a **GNU**
Rust toolchain, because MSVC cannot link MSYS2's import libraries, and the C++ shims are built
from pkg-config's flags, which an online-installer Qt does not ship:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6-base                              # Qt
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4 mingw-w64-x86_64-libadwaita      # GTK
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

On ARM64 hosts, use the CLANGARM64 environment's `mingw-w64-clang-aarch64-` packages and the
`stable-aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm` toolchain. Build with MSYS2's `bin` on `PATH` and
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` set to the GNU toolchain; the
[Windows page](/docs/platforms/windows-xaml#qt-and-gtk-on-a-windows-host) walks through it.

## Linux

Day's minimums are library versions: **GTK 4.10 with libadwaita 1.5**, and **Qt 6**. Any
distribution whose repositories carry those development packages works. Continuous integration
builds on Ubuntu 24.04.

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev pkg-config     # linux-gtk
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev pkg-config                      # linux-qt
```

The GTK minimums are hard requirements. Day builds navigation on `AdwNavigationView` and
`AdwOverlaySplitView`, and its file and alert dialogs on `GtkFileDialog` and `GtkAlertDialog`;
none of those exist in earlier releases. **Debian 12 ships GTK 4.8 and cannot build `linux-gtk`**;
run `-p linux-qt` there, which needs only Qt 6, or build against a newer runtime. `day doctor`
reports the installed versions against these minimums, so run it first; a version miss otherwise
surfaces as a build failure inside `gdk4-sys`.

Fedora, Arch, and openSUSE ship the same libraries under their own names; check
[GTK's installation page](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux) and
[Qt's](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux.html) for the equivalents.

Day finds both toolkits through `pkg-config`, so it is required.

## Optional: web views

The [web view piece](/docs/internal/webview) needs one extra development package on the Linux
desktop toolkits. Without it the piece compiles out and renders a placeholder; the rest of the app
is unaffected.

| Toolkit | Package | Engine |
|---|---|---|
| GTK | `libwebkitgtk-6.0-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu), `mingw-w64-x86_64-webkitgtk6` (MSYS2) | [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org) 6 |
| Qt | `qt6-webengine-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu) | [Qt WebEngine](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwebengine-index.html) |

Two toolkit combinations have no web view package. Homebrew's `webkitgtk` vends the GTK 3
API and has no bottle, so `macos-gtk` builds without a web view. MSYS2 ships no Qt 6 WebEngine, so
`windows-qt` does too.

## Optional: packaging tools

These are needed only to produce an installable artifact with `day pack`; building and running
an app needs none of them. [Packaging & distribution](/docs/packaging) covers the formats
themselves.

| Target | Tool | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `linux-gtk`, `linux-qt` | `flatpak-builder` | [flatpak.org](https://flatpak.org/setup/), plus the Flathub remote |
| `linux-gtk`, `linux-qt` | `linuxdeploy` and its GTK or Qt plugin | [linuxdeploy releases](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/releases) |
| `windows-xaml` | `makeappx`, `signtool` | the Windows 10/11 SDK (installed with the Build Tools) |
| `windows-xaml` | `makensis` | [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io), or `choco install nsis` |

Without the `linuxdeploy` GTK or Qt plugin an AppImage still builds, but it will only run on a
machine that already has the toolkit installed.

## Android

Android cross-compiles the app to a JNI shared library and runs it inside a Gradle app, so it needs
the Android SDK, an NDK, and a JDK regardless of which host you are on.

1. Install the **Android SDK**, most easily through
   [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), or the standalone
   [command-line tools](https://developer.android.com/tools). Day finds it at the platform default
   (`~/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` on Windows, `~/Android/Sdk` on
   Linux); set `ANDROID_HOME` if yours is elsewhere.
2. Install an **NDK** with `sdkmanager --install "ndk;<version>"`, or from Android Studio's SDK
   Manager under *SDK Tools*. Day uses the newest one under `<sdk>/ndk` unless
   `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` says otherwise.
3. Install a **JDK, version 17 or newer** (`brew install openjdk@21`, or
   [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net)). The Gradle build uses `$JAVA_HOME`, so set it if the `java`
   on your `PATH` is older.
4. Add the Rust target and `cargo-ndk`:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android    # arm64 device or emulator
rustup target add x86_64-linux-android     # x86_64 emulator
cargo install cargo-ndk
```

### Setting up an emulator

Create an AVD in Android Studio's **Device Manager**, or with `avdmanager create avd`, then start
it:

```bash
emulator -avd <name>
adb devices                 # confirm it is listed as `device`
```

The `day` CLI has no Android-emulator command of its own; use Android Studio or the SDK's own
tools. Match the emulator's ABI to an installed Rust target; an x86_64 system image needs
`x86_64-linux-android`. Set `ANDROID_SERIAL` when more than one device or emulator is attached, so
`day launch` and `day drive` act on the one you mean.

A booted emulator is needed only to run an app.

## iOS

`ios-uikit` builds on a macOS host with full Xcode, as covered above. Xcode installs one iOS
simulator runtime; add others from Xcode's settings under *Platforms* (or *Components*, depending
on your Xcode version); Apple documents the flow in
[Installing additional simulator runtimes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/installing-additional-simulator-runtimes).

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices          # what exists, and what is booted
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"  # or open Simulator.app
```

`day launch -p ios-uikit` installs into a booted simulator, so boot one first. Apps ship to a
physical device through Xcode's normal signing setup; nothing extra is needed for the Simulator.

## HarmonyOS

HarmonyOS has two halves with different tool needs, which is why a partial install is common. The
[HarmonyOS platform page](/docs/platforms/harmony-arkui) has the detail.

1. **The Rust cross-compile** needs the OpenHarmony SDK's `native` component, which downloads
   without a Huawei account from
   [repo.huaweicloud.com](https://repo.huaweicloud.com/openharmony/os/). Point `OHOS_NDK_HOME` at
   it, and add the targets:

   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos x86_64-unknown-linux-ohos
   ```

2. **Packaging the `.hap`** needs `hvigor` and `ohpm`, which are not part of the public SDK. They
   ship with the OpenHarmony **command-line-tools**, bundled with
   [DevEco Studio](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/deveco-studio/) or downloadable on
   their own. Put their `bin/` directories on `PATH`.

`hdc`, which installs and launches the app, sits in the SDK's sibling `toolchains/` directory; Day
finds it there or on `PATH`.

### Setting up an emulator

Day runs the [Oniro](https://oniroproject.org) OpenHarmony emulator directly under QEMU, from a
public image download:

```bash
brew install qemu                        # or your distro's qemu-system-x86_64
# download oniro_emulator.zip and unpack its images, then:
export DAY_OHOS_EMULATOR=~/ohos/emulator/images
day ohos emulator launch                 # --headless for CI
```

The image comes from the
[device_board_oniro releases](https://github.com/eclipse-oniro4openharmony/device_board_oniro/releases)
(v6.1 is what Day's own CI runs). `DAY_OHOS_EMULATOR` defaults to `~/ohos/emulator/images`, so you
can skip the variable by unpacking there.

The x86_64 emulator image carries an arm64-only ArkWeb engine, so the web view piece does not
render there. It works on a physical device.

## Web

`web-dom` needs only the wasm target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

`day build -p web-dom` writes a self-contained static site, and `day launch -p web-dom` serves it
and opens a browser. Rust and the `day` CLI are the entire toolchain.

## What your apps require

These are the minimums your *users* need, which the scaffold sets and you can raise in your
project's platform configuration. They are unrelated to what your development machine needs.

| Target | Minimum |
|---|---|
| `macos-appkit` | macOS 13 |
| `ios-uikit` | iOS 16 |
| `android-mdc` | API level 24 (Android 7.0), compiled against API 37 |
| `harmony-arkui` | API level 18 |
| `windows-xaml` | Windows 10 or 11 |
| `linux-gtk` / `linux-qt` | GTK 4.10 with libadwaita 1.5 / Qt 6 |
| `web-dom` | a current browser, served as static files |
