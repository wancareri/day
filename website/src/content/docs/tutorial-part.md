Reading the battery, checking connectivity, and firing a haptic tap each go through a different
native API per platform, often in a different language. A **part** covers this case: a small
headless crate that presents one flat cross-platform Rust API and picks the right native
implementation per target.

This tutorial builds `day-part-battery`, which lives in the Day workspace at
[`parts/day-part-battery/`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/parts/day-part-battery). By
the end you will have a `day_part_battery::status()` function that reads the battery through IOKit
on macOS, `UIDevice` on iOS, a Java `BatteryManager` shim on Android, sysfs on Linux,
`GetSystemPowerStatus` on Windows, and a native `.so` on HarmonyOS. Each uses whatever language fits
that platform, and all of them sit behind one signature.

## 1. What a part is (and when to build one)

A **part** is a *headless capability crate*. It has:

- **No UI:** it has no renderer, so it never depends on a toolkit.
- **A flat cross-platform API:** one or two free functions like `status() -> Option<BatteryStatus>`.
- **Per-OS native implementations**, selected at compile time by `#[cfg(target_os = "…")]` rather
  than a Cargo feature, because a battery is an OS concern rather than a toolkit one.

A **piece** is a reusable UI widget (a `combo_box`, a `web_view`) that *does* register a per-toolkit
renderer. Pieces live in [`pieces/`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces); parts live
in [`parts/`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/parts), the non-UI counterpart. Choose by
whether the crate has a UI:

- Building a **visible control** backed by a native widget? Write a **piece**; see
  [the piece tutorial](/docs/internal/extending) and [`pieces/day-piece-searchfield`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-searchfield).
- Exposing a **device service** with no UI of its own? Write a **part**.

A part reuses the same build-contribution channel pieces use (the `[package.metadata.day.*]` keys
that fold native assets into the app build) but registers nothing into any `RENDERERS` slice.

## 2. Scaffold: the flat API and the cfg/path dispatch

Start with the scaffolder. `day new part` generates almost all of the layout below: `Cargo.toml`, a
`src/lib.rs` with the `#[cfg]`/`#[path]` dispatch already wired (including the mandatory
`None`-returning fallback), a stub `src/<os>.rs` per platform, an `examples/` runner, and, when you
target Android, the `android/java/.../Day<Name>.java` shim plus the `[package.metadata.day.android]`
block:

```bash
day new part day-part-battery --platforms macos,ios,android,linux,windows
```

Omit `--platforms` to get that same default set, which is also the full set the scaffolder knows
(`macos`, `ios`, `android`, `linux`, `windows`). The battery crate's HarmonyOS arm below was added
by hand afterward, the way any extra platform is: one more `#[cfg]`/`#[path]` line and one more
file. As with pieces, the crate builds immediately against
a remote Day release; add `--local <path>` to point at a local Day checkout instead. The sections
below explain each generated file.

A part is an ordinary library crate with this layout:

```

├── android/java/dev/daybrite/day/battery/DayBattery.java   # Android backend (Java)
├── examples/battery.rs                                     # a plain `main`, no Day at all

```

### The public surface

`lib.rs` defines a plain data struct and a single entry point. Callers see the same types on every
platform.

```rust
/// A snapshot of the device battery.
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct BatteryStatus {
    /// Charge fraction in `0.0..=1.0`, or `None` if the level is unknown (e.g. a simulator).
    pub level: Option<f32>,
    /// Charging / discharging / …
    pub state: BatteryState,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum BatteryState {
    Charging,
    Discharging,
    Full,
    NotCharging,
    #[default]
    Unknown,
}

impl BatteryStatus {
    /// The charge level as a whole percentage `0..=100`, if known.
    pub fn percent(&self) -> Option<u8> {
        self.level.map(|l| (l.clamp(0.0, 1.0) * 100.0).round() as u8)
    }
    pub fn is_charging(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self.state, BatteryState::Charging)
    }
}

/// Read the current battery status via the platform's native API. Returns `None` when there is no
/// battery API for the platform, or the device has no battery.
pub fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus> {
    imp::status()
}
```

The public `status()` is a one-liner that forwards to `imp::status()`. `imp` is a different module
on every platform, and that indirection does the dispatch.

### The cfg/path dispatch (and the mandatory fallback)

Below the API, `lib.rs` binds `imp` to exactly one file per target with `#[cfg]` + `#[path]`. Each
file exposes the same private `fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus>`:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
#[path = "macos.rs"]
mod imp;

#[cfg(target_os = "ios")]
#[path = "ios.rs"]
mod imp;

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
#[path = "windows.rs"]
mod imp;

// Desktop/embedded Linux reads sysfs; HarmonyOS (also `target_os = "linux"`) sandboxes that away,
// so it uses its own native battery API instead.
#[cfg(all(target_os = "linux", not(target_env = "ohos")))]
#[path = "linux.rs"]
mod imp;

#[cfg(all(target_os = "linux", target_env = "ohos"))]
#[path = "ohos.rs"]
mod imp;

#[cfg(target_os = "android")]
#[path = "android.rs"]
mod imp;

// Any other platform: no native battery API. This arm is mandatory.
#[cfg(not(any(
    target_os = "macos",
    target_os = "ios",
    target_os = "windows",
    target_os = "linux",
    target_os = "android"
)))]
mod imp {
    pub fn status() -> Option<super::BatteryStatus> {
        None
    }
}
```

- **HarmonyOS is `target_os = "linux"`** but sandboxes `/sys` away, so it is disambiguated with
  `target_env = "ohos"`: one arm for desktop Linux, one for OpenHarmony.
- **The catch-all `#[cfg(not(any(...)))]` fallback is not optional.** Without it, `status()` would
  fail to compile on any target you did not enumerate (a WASM build, a BSD, a bare `cargo check` on
  an exotic host). The fallback module returns `None` so the crate compiles everywhere and reports
  "no battery API here." The fallback makes the API's `Option` promise hold on every target.

Every arm is mutually exclusive, so exactly one `imp` is compiled into any given binary. Dispatch
happens at compile time: the AppKit build contains only the IOKit path, and the Android build only
the JNI path.

### Cargo.toml: target-gated dependencies

Because each platform needs different crates (and most need none), dependencies are declared
per-target so they are only pulled in where they compile:

```toml
[package]
name = "day-part-battery"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true

# No shared [dependencies]; the flat API is pure std.
[dependencies]

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]
core-foundation = "0.10"
core-foundation-sys = "0.8"

[target.'cfg(target_os = "ios")'.dependencies]
objc2 = "0.6"
objc2-ui-kit = { version = "0.3", features = ["UIDevice"] }

# Android reads BatteryManager through a Java shim + day-android's cached JVM/Context. This is the one
# platform where the headless crate runs on the Day runtime (like the pieces' Android backends).
[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
day-android = { workspace = true }
```

There is no `[features]` table, because the target selects the implementation and a part has no
backends to toggle. (Linux and Windows need no crates at all; they use pure std or raw FFI.)

## 3. A native implementation per platform

Every `imp::status()` has the same signature, but behind it each platform speaks its own language
and its own API. Here are four of them in detail.

### macOS: Rust calling C (IOKit, via `#[link]`)

macOS has no crate wrapping the power API, so `macos.rs` declares the three IOKit functions it needs
with a plain `extern "C"` block and force-links the framework with `#[link(name = "IOKit", kind =
"framework")]`. CoreFoundation (via the `core-foundation` crate) handles the dictionary access:

```rust
use super::{BatteryState, BatteryStatus};
use core_foundation_sys::base::{CFRelease, CFTypeRef};
use core_foundation_sys::array::{CFArrayGetCount, CFArrayGetValueAtIndex, CFArrayRef};
use core_foundation_sys::dictionary::CFDictionaryRef;

#[link(name = "IOKit", kind = "framework")]
unsafe extern "C" {
    fn IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo() -> CFTypeRef;
    fn IOPSCopyPowerSourcesList(blob: CFTypeRef) -> CFArrayRef;
    fn IOPSGetPowerSourceDescription(blob: CFTypeRef, ps: CFTypeRef) -> CFDictionaryRef;
}

pub fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus> {
    unsafe {
        let blob = IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo();
        if blob.is_null() { return None; }
        // walk IOPSCopyPowerSourcesList(blob), read "Current Capacity" / "Max Capacity" /
        // "Is Charging" / "Power Source State" out of each source's CFDictionary …
        // then CFRelease(blob); Copy-rule ownership means we release what we copied.
        unimplemented!()
    }
}
```

`day-part-network` shows the same plain-C style even more minimally: its shared `src/apple.rs`
declares SystemConfiguration's reachability API with two `extern "C"` functions and a locally-declared
`sockaddr_in`, with no crates at all:

```rust
#[link(name = "SystemConfiguration", kind = "framework")]
unsafe extern "C" {
    fn SCNetworkReachabilityCreateWithAddress(
        allocator: *const c_void,
        address: *const SockaddrIn,
    ) -> *const c_void;
    fn SCNetworkReachabilityGetFlags(target: *const c_void, flags: *mut u32) -> u8;
}
```

### iOS: Rust calling Objective-C (UIDevice, via objc2)

iOS has ready-made bindings, so `ios.rs` uses the `objc2-ui-kit` crate directly; there is no
hand-rolled FFI. `UIDevice` is main-thread-only, which the `MainThreadMarker` encodes at the type
level:

```rust
use super::{BatteryState, BatteryStatus};
use objc2::MainThreadMarker;
use objc2_ui_kit::{UIDevice, UIDeviceBatteryState};

pub fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus> {
    let mtm = MainThreadMarker::new()?;          // None off the main thread → status() is None
    let device = UIDevice::currentDevice(mtm);
    device.setBatteryMonitoringEnabled(true);
    let raw = device.batteryLevel();             // 0.0–1.0, or -1 when unknown
    let level = if raw < 0.0 { None } else { Some(raw) };
    let state = match device.batteryState() {
        UIDeviceBatteryState::Charging => BatteryState::Charging,
        UIDeviceBatteryState::Unplugged => BatteryState::Discharging,
        UIDeviceBatteryState::Full => BatteryState::Full,
        _ => BatteryState::Unknown,
    };
    Some(BatteryStatus { level, state })
}
```

### Android: Rust calling Java (a `BatteryManager` shim over JNI)

On Android, reading `BatteryManager` cleanly needs a `Context` and a sticky broadcast, which is
far easier in Java than through raw JNI. So the part carries its own small Java class and calls it
over the bridge. This is the one platform where a part runs on the Day runtime; it borrows the JVM
and `Context` that `day-android` already caches.

> [!NOTE] The shipped crate does this with a bridge now
> Everything in this section is the mechanism underneath, and it still works as described, but
> `day-part-battery` itself has since moved its Android half to a
> [daybridge](/docs/internal/bridge) arm: the Java lives inline in `src/android.rs` beside the Rust
> declaration it implements, and the JNI call and the packed-`long` protocol below are generated,
> so the checked-in `.java` file and the `java = [...]` table are gone. Read this section to

> writing one looks like.

The Java shim reads the sticky `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` intent and packs the reading into a `long` so
it crosses the JNI boundary as a single primitive (no object marshaling):

```java
package dev.daybrite.day.battery;

import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.IntentFilter;
import android.os.BatteryManager;

import dev.daybrite.day.bridge.DayBridge;   // day-android's public surface

public final class DayBattery {
    private DayBattery() {}

    /** Packs (state << 8) | levelByte; levelByte 0..100 or 255 = unknown. */
    public static long read() {
        Context ctx = DayBridge.ctx;                 // the cached app Context
        int level = -1, state = 0;
        if (ctx != null) {
            IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED);
            Intent intent = ctx.registerReceiver(null, filter);   // sticky broadcast, no receiver
            if (intent != null) {
                int lvl = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_LEVEL, -1);
                int scale = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_SCALE, -1);
                if (lvl >= 0 && scale > 0) level = Math.round(lvl * 100f / scale);
                switch (intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_STATUS,
                        BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_UNKNOWN)) {
                    case BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_CHARGING:     state = 1; break;
                    case BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_DISCHARGING:  state = 2; break;
                    case BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_FULL:         state = 3; break;
                    case BatteryManager.BATTERY_STATUS_NOT_CHARGING: state = 4; break;
                    default:                                         state = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        long levelByte = (level < 0) ? 255 : Math.min(100, level);
        return ((long) state << 8) | levelByte;
    }
}
```

The Java uses only `day-android`'s public surface (`DayBridge.ctx`). The Rust side calls the static
method through `day-android`'s re-exported `jni`, using `with_env` to grab the attached `JNIEnv`, then
unpacks the `long`:

```rust
use super::{BatteryState, BatteryStatus};
use day_android::with_env;

const BATTERY_CLASS: &str = "dev/daybrite/day/battery/DayBattery";

pub fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus> {
    let packed: i64 = with_env(|env| {
        env.call_static_method(BATTERY_CLASS, "read", "()J", &[])   // ()J = () -> long
            .ok()
            .and_then(|v| v.j().ok())
    })?;

    let level_byte = (packed & 0xFF) as u8;
    let level = if level_byte == 255 { None } else { Some(level_byte as f32 / 100.0) };
    let state = match (packed >> 8) & 0xFF {
        1 => BatteryState::Charging,
        2 => BatteryState::Discharging,
        3 => BatteryState::Full,
        4 => BatteryState::NotCharging,
        _ => BatteryState::Unknown,
    };
    Some(BatteryStatus { level, state })
}
```

### Linux: pure Rust std (sysfs)

This arm is pure `std`. The kernel publishes power supplies under `/sys/class/power_supply/<name>/`,
so `linux.rs` reads a few files with `std::fs`:

```rust
use super::{BatteryState, BatteryStatus};
use std::{fs, path::Path};

pub fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus> {
    for entry in fs::read_dir("/sys/class/power_supply").ok()?.flatten() {
        let dir = entry.path();
        if fs::read_to_string(dir.join("type")).unwrap_or_default().trim() != "Battery" {
            continue;
        }
        let level = fs::read_to_string(dir.join("capacity")).ok()
            .and_then(|s| s.trim().parse::<f32>().ok())
            .map(|c| (c / 100.0).clamp(0.0, 1.0));
        let state = match fs::read_to_string(dir.join("status")).unwrap_or_default().trim() {
            "Charging" => BatteryState::Charging,
            "Discharging" => BatteryState::Discharging,
            "Full" => BatteryState::Full,
            "Not charging" => BatteryState::NotCharging,
            _ => BatteryState::Unknown,
        };
        return Some(BatteryStatus { level, state });
    }
    None
}
```

### Windows & HarmonyOS: more C FFI

The two remaining targets are both raw C-ABI FFI, in the same style as macOS:

- **Windows** (`windows.rs`) links `kernel32` and calls `GetSystemPowerStatus`, filling a `#[repr(C)]
  SYSTEM_POWER_STATUS` struct. It uses no crate, was written blind against the Win32 docs, and is
  compiled only on the Windows target.

  ```rust
  #[link(name = "kernel32")]
  unsafe extern "system" {
      fn GetSystemPowerStatus(status: *mut SystemPowerStatus) -> c_int;
  }
  ```

- **HarmonyOS** (`ohos.rs`, gated on `target_env = "ohos"`) links the native BasicServicesKit library
  and calls its two C functions directly, without going through the ArkTS bridge or the Day runtime:

  ```rust
  #[link(name = "ohbattery_info")]
  unsafe extern "C" {
      fn OH_BatteryInfo_GetCapacity() -> c_int;
      fn OH_BatteryInfo_GetPluggedType() -> c_int;
  }
  ```

## 4. Contribute native artifacts to the app build

The Rust FFI paths (macOS, Windows, HarmonyOS, iOS-objc2, Linux) need nothing extra; `cargo` links
them. But four platforms can need assets folded into the app's native build: Android needs the
`.java` file compiled and (for some parts) a manifest permission or component; iOS and macOS need
certain system frameworks linked (or Swift sources compiled); HarmonyOS takes ArkTS sources via an
`ets` key under `[package.metadata.day.ohos]`. There is also a portable
`[package.metadata.day.permissions]` table (`uses = ["camera"]`) that maps one permission name to
each platform's declaration. A part declares all of this in its own `Cargo.toml`, and `day build`
merges it into the app from that file alone.

### Android: staging the Java shim and a permission

```toml
[package.metadata.day.android]
java = ["android/java"]                                   # → Gradle java srcDirs
permissions = ["android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"] # → <uses-permission> overlay (if needed)
manifest-components = ["android/components.xml"]          # → <receiver>/<service> overlay (if needed)
```

`day-part-battery` needs no permission (the sticky battery broadcast is unrestricted), so it declares
only `java = ["android/java"]`. `day-part-network`, whose `ConnectivityManager` call *does* require
`ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`, adds the `permissions` line above.

`manifest-components` is required when a part's Java half is a `BroadcastReceiver` or a `Service`:
Android instantiates those by name from the manifest, so without the declaration the receiver never
reaches the APK and the part silently does nothing. `day-part-local-notify` (its `AlarmManager`
receiver) is the reference. The table also takes `res` (piece-shipped Android resources),
`gradle-repositories` (extra Maven repos), and `proguard` (R8 keep rules for classes native code
reaches by name); see the [extending reference](/docs/internal/extending).

When you run `day build -p android-mdc`, the CLI runs `cargo metadata`, walks the app's entire
dependency closure, and collects every part's and piece's `[package.metadata.day.android]` blocks
into `build/day/android/day-pieces.json`, plus a generated overlay manifest for the permissions. The
app's checked-in Gradle scaffold reads that file generically (a loop over the JSON, with no per-part
entries) and adds each Java source dir and each `<uses-permission>`. Add a part to your `Cargo.toml`
and its Java appears in the build.

### iOS: linking a system framework

```toml
[package.metadata.day.ios]
frameworks = ["SystemConfiguration"]
```

This is what `day-part-network` declares (its `apple.rs` drives SystemConfiguration). The
`#[link(name = "SystemConfiguration", kind = "framework")]` directive in the Rust source is not
enough, because cargo honors it only when it drives the final link, i.e. on the macOS desktop build.
On iOS, `xcodebuild` links the Rust staticlib and does not read Rust link metadata, so the app
itself must link the framework. `day build -p ios-uikit` generates a local SwiftPM package
(`build/day/ios/DayPieces`) whose `linkerSettings` list every part's declared frameworks; the app's
one checked-in `.xcodeproj` depends on that package. So an iOS framework dependency is `Cargo.toml`
data, and the `.xcodeproj` stays unchanged.

A `[package.metadata.day.macos]` table of the same shape covers the macos-appkit leg: `day build`
hands the contributions to the `platform/macos/` Xcode host project through the same generated
package. `day-part-local-notify` declares `frameworks = ["UserNotifications"]` under both tables.
Both also take a `platform` key (`platform = "16.0"`) to raise the minimum-OS floor when the
native API needs it; the max across contributing crates wins.

`day-part-battery` itself declares no `[package.metadata.day.ios]`: it uses `objc2-ui-kit`, and UIKit
is auto-linked by the iOS SDK. You only need the `frameworks` key for a system framework that is not
linked by default (SystemConfiguration, WebKit, …).

This is the same contribution channel [`pieces/day-piece-searchfield`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-searchfield) (Android Java + Gradle deps) and
[`pieces/day-piece-webview`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-webview) (a framework + a permission) use.
## 5. Use it

Any Rust code (inside a Day app or a plain binary) depends on the crate and calls the function:

```rust
fn main() {
    match day_part_battery::status() {
        Some(b) => println!(
            "battery: {:?}, {} charging={}",
            b.state,
            b.percent().map(|p| format!("{p}%")).unwrap_or("?".into()),
            b.is_charging(),
        ),
        None => println!("no battery API (or no battery) on this platform"),
    }
}
```

That is
[`parts/day-part-battery/examples/battery.rs`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/blob/main/parts/day-part-battery/examples/battery.rs)
unchanged: a `main` with no Day dependency, which `cargo run -p day-part-battery --example battery`
runs. Inside a Day app you would bind the reading into a `Signal` and drive a `label` or a `canvas`
gauge with it, but the part itself knows nothing about UI.

On a target with no battery API (or a device with no battery, or the iOS simulator), `status()`
returns `None`, and the fallback module from step 2 keeps the crate compiling everywhere. A test in
the crate checks this:

```rust
#[test]
fn status_does_not_panic() {
    let s = super::status();
    if let Some(b) = s {
        assert!(b.percent().is_none_or(|p| p <= 100));
    }
}
```

## 6. Drafting the native shims

Covering six platforms means writing Objective-C, Java, and Win32 C interop on top of Rust. The
hardest part is knowing which API to call. Once you do, the shim is small and mechanical, the kind
of thing an LLM drafts well.

The recommended workflow:

1. **Write the Rust `imp` signature first.** `fn status() -> Option<BatteryStatus>` is the contract
   every platform must satisfy. Decide the wire format up front (the packed-`long` trick the Android
   shim uses is a good pattern: it keeps the JNI/FFI boundary to a single primitive).
2. **Ask an LLM to draft the native side** from a one-line description of the platform API: "a Java
   method that reads `BatteryManager` from a `Context` and returns `(state << 8) | level` as a
   `long`", or "a C call to `GetSystemPowerStatus` filling `SYSTEM_POWER_STATUS`", or "the
   Objective-C to read `UIDevice.batteryLevel`".The Windows and HarmonyOS impls in this crate were written
   blind (no Windows or Harmony host) because the API call is small and well specified.
3. **Wire the FFI yourself.** Declare the `extern` block or the JNI `call_static_method`, unpack the
   value, and map it to your enum. This is the part where types and ownership rules matter, and where
   you want to read carefully, but it is short.

Split this way, supporting one more platform is a ~30-line shim, one `#[cfg]/#[path]` arm, and (on
Android or iOS) one line of `Cargo.toml` metadata.
