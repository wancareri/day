Every cross-platform stack makes different choices. This page describes what Day gives you and
what it asks of you, and names the situations where another tool is the better fit.

## The options

Four established ways to ship one app on many platforms:

| Approach | Examples | Strength | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web view shell | Electron, Tauri | Web skills, one DOM UI | The interface runs inside a browser engine; platform integration goes through it |
| Custom renderer | Flutter, egui, Slint | Pixel-identical UI, hot reload (Flutter) | Text, scrolling, and accessibility are the framework's own implementations |
| Shared logic, native UI | Kotlin Multiplatform, Skip | Fully native UI | The single UI codebase; you still write each UI |
| Native widgets, one codebase | **Day**, React Native* | Native widgets and one UI codebase | Pixel-identical branding; some framework-mediated control |

\* React Native shares the native-widgets premise for mobile; it differs in language (JS + a
bridge), in update model (re-render + reconcile), and in desktop coverage.

## What you get

### Native fidelity without per-platform UI code

Text rendering, input methods, spellcheck,
scrolling physics, selection, drag, focus behavior, dark-mode chrome, screen readers: these come
from the platform's widgets, and they improve with OS updates.

### A runtime profile you can reason about

Day builds the widget tree once and binds state to
native attributes. A state change re-runs only the closures that read that value — a label's
text closure, say — and each ends in one native setter call ([how this works](/docs/reactivity)).
The compiler monomorphizes your app against one toolkit [backend](/docs/glossary#backend) per binary, so a widget update
is a direct call. Binaries are ordinary Rust binaries that link the system's libraries.

### One language for everything

UI, state, logic, tests, and build tooling are Rust, so the
borrow checker applies to your UI code the same way it applies to everything else. Whether
that's a benefit depends on your team; see the costs below.

### Localized, accessible, scriptable, extensible

These four compose: localized strings are [reactive](/docs/glossary#reactive), so
[locale](/docs/glossary#locale) switches update a running app; accessibility identifiers double as automation ids; one
[dayscript](/docs/glossary#dayscript) [walkthrough](/docs/glossary#walkthrough), run per-locale, is simultaneously an end-to-end test
([dayscript](/docs/dayscript)), an accessibility audit ([accessibility](/docs/accessibility)),
and a screenshot generator ([localization](/docs/localization)).

1. **Localizable** — Mozilla [Fluent](/docs/glossary#fluent) throughout, with ICU-correct plurals, number and date
   formatting, and collation-aware sorting, with locale data thinned to the locales you ship.
   The current locale is a [signal](/docs/glossary#signal). ([guide](/docs/localization))
2. **Accessible** — native widgets give a native accessibility tree as the baseline; Day adds
   uniform annotations and stable identifiers, and CI can diff the native tree against your
   declarations. ([guide](/docs/accessibility))
3. **Scriptable** — a YAML automation language drives the running app over a socket, identically
   on every platform. ([guide](/docs/dayscript))
4. **Extensible** — new widgets plug in as ordinary crates, from pure composition down to
   per-toolkit native code, without forking Day. ([how](/docs/extending))

### Tooling built for CI and agents as much as humans

`day doctor` diagnoses all eight [target](/docs/glossary#target)
toolchains with fix-it text; `day launch` runs any subset of twelve targets; `day pack`
[produces signed installable artifacts](/docs/packaging); every command can print JSON.

## What you give up

### Hot reload

Rust compiles ahead of time. The edit loop is an incremental compile plus
relaunch (seconds on desktop, longer for mobile targets), with dayscript replay to restore UI
state. Flutter's sub-second stateful hot reload is better for exploratory UI work, and
nothing in Day currently matches it.

### Pixel-level brand control

Your app looks like a Mac app on macOS and a Material app on
Android. If the design brief is a custom design system rendered identically everywhere, with custom
controls, custom motion, and brand color on every surface, Day's native-widget premise works against
you, and a renderer (Flutter, or Rust-native options like Slint or egui) is the better fit.
[Styling](/docs/styling) lists what you can restyle and what stays native. On macOS and iOS the
escape hatch is [SwiftUI embedding](/docs/internal/swiftui): a custom control written in SwiftUI
drops into the Day tree as an ordinary [piece](/docs/glossary#piece).

### Ecosystem maturity

Flutter has years of production hardening, thousands of packages, and an
enormous community. Day is young: the widget vocabulary is small, some designed
features aren't implemented yet (semantic color tokens, an animation scheduler,
form validation; [Platform support](/docs/platforms) keeps the current list), and you will hit
edges. A Matrix chat client runs on five targets, and every target is exercised in CI with
screenshot validation on every push. How much testing a given target gets varies, and
[support tiers](/docs/platforms#support-tiers) say which ones get the most.

### Rust, with a single-threaded UI

If your team doesn't know Rust, learning it is part of the
project. UI state is main-thread-only by construction (`Signal` isn't `Send`); background work
returns through explicit `Setter`/`on_main` calls. The compiler enforcing this
prevents a whole bug class, and it also means there's no casual shared-state shortcut when you
want one.

### Platform variance is still yours to test

Native widgets differ in focus order, dialog
conventions, and text metrics, so each platform still needs testing even though dayscript makes
that cheap. Day also can't script what it
doesn't own: native keyboards, IME composition, and OS dialogs still need occasional manual
checks per platform.

### Framework-mediated platform access

When you need a platform API Day doesn't surface, you
write it yourself; the [parts](/docs/parts) pattern makes this a normal, contained thing to do
(a few `cfg`-gated functions per platform), but it's work a single-platform app wouldn't have.

## Choosing

Pick **Electron or Tauri** when your product *is* a web UI, your team is a web team, and desktop
integration depth matters less than shipping this quarter. Pick **Flutter** when design-system
uniformity across platforms is a requirement, or when hot-reload-driven iteration speed dominates
everything else. Pick **per-platform native** when you're on one platform, or when each platform
app has its own team and roadmap. Pick **Day** when you want one Rust codebase and each platform's
own widgets, and you accept a young framework's gaps
in exchange for a runtime model with very little between your code and the platform.
