Local notifications let an app deliver reminders and status updates through the operating
system. `day-part-local-notify` supports immediate and scheduled delivery, including reminders
due after the app has closed. Posting a notification requires permission and a configured channel:

```rust
Notification::new("Timer done")
    .body("Your 5 minute timer finished.")
    .channel("timers")
    .route("clock/timer")
    .post()?;
```

**Works on:** iOS, macOS, and Android. Support is selected by `target_os` and applies to every backend on those operating systems. Linux, Windows, HarmonyOS, and the web compile the same code and report
`NotifyError::Unsupported`; gate the UI with `capabilities()` (step 6). The full design and the
per-platform details are in [the notify reference](/docs/internal/notify).

## 1. Declare the permission

Consent belongs to `day-part-permissions`; this crate builds on it, so there is one prompt.
The build-time half is one line in your `Day.toml`:

```toml
[permissions]
notifications = true      # needs no reason string on any platform
```

Most permissions take a user-facing reason as their value, the sentence the OS shows in its
prompt. Notifications are the one portable permission that needs none, so `true` is enough.
`day build` generates the platform entries from this (`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on Android 13+; Apple
needs no `Info.plist` key for local notifications).

## 2. Request consent at runtime

Declaring the permission does not request it. An app must still request
`Permission::Notifications`, and on Apple
the failure mode for skipping this is silent: the system accepts every post and drops it with no
error. The Apple arm cannot warn you either: its settings accessor is async-only, so `post()`
never returns `PermissionDenied` there.

```rust
use day_part_permissions::{Permission, Status, request, status};

if status(Permission::Notifications) != Status::Granted {
    let set = granted.setter();       // Signal<bool> in your UI state
    request(Permission::Notifications, move |s| {
        set.set(s == Status::Granted);
    });
}
```

The callback may run on another thread, so deliver into UI state through a `Setter`. The full
flow (priming UI, `can_prompt`, the switch to Open Settings after a final denial) is
[Permissions](/docs/guide-permissions).

## 3. Post one now

Every notification posts on a channel. Channels exist because Android has a per-channel settings
model the user owns; on Apple a channel still groups notifications and carries their importance and
sound. Register the channel once, before posting to it; registration is idempotent:

```rust
use day_part_local_notify::{Channel, Importance, Notification};

Channel::new("timers", Importance::High).sound(true).register();

let id = Notification::new("Timer done")
    .body("Your 5 minute timer finished.")
    .channel("timers")
    .post()?;
```

Choose the importance for the behavior you want. `Importance::High` or above shows a heads-up
banner on Android; `Default` files the notification into the shade with no banner, which reads as
"the button did nothing". On Android the importance is immutable after first registration (the
user owns the channel from then on), which is why it's a required argument at `Channel::new`
rather than a setter.

`post()` returns a `NotifId`. Posting again with the same id (via `.id(id)`) updates the existing
notification in place instead of stacking a second one.

## 4. Schedule and cancel

`Trigger` has three variants: `Now` (the default), `In(Duration)`, and `At(SystemTime)`, the
alarm-clock form that fires at an absolute instant:

```rust
use day_part_local_notify::{Trigger, cancel};
use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};

let id = Notification::new("Stand up")
    .channel("timers")
    .trigger(Trigger::In(Duration::from_secs(20 * 60)))
    .post()?;

cancel(id);                           // or cancel_all()

let wake = SystemTime::now() + Duration::from_secs(8 * 3600);
Notification::new("Good morning")
    .channel("alarms")
    .trigger(Trigger::At(wake))
    .post()?;
```

`At` takes an instant, not a civil time: resolve "06:30 tomorrow" to a `SystemTime` yourself
(a tzdb crate such as jiff has the zone arithmetic; Day-Time's `timezone` module shows the pattern), and re-derive on each foreground if you're tracking
a local-time target across DST changes. An instant already in the past fires immediately.

Where `capabilities().schedule_while_dead` is true, the OS holds the trigger and fires it even if
the app has exited. On Apple the system holds the schedule itself. Android has no notification
scheduler, so the part sets an `AlarmManager` alarm that wakes a receiver; a reboot clears every
alarm, and the part's boot receiver re-arms schedules from persisted data. When Android withholds
the exact-alarm grant, `capabilities().schedule_exact` is false and the notification still arrives,
possibly late in Doze. Declaring `android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM` in your app's
`[package.metadata.day.android]` gets the install-time exact-alarm grant (Play restricts it to clock
and calendar apps, so the part can't declare it for you), and scheduling on a channel registered
with `Importance::Urgent` goes through `AlarmManager.setAlarmClock`, the Doze-exempt path that shows
the status-bar alarm icon.

A scheduled notification may fire in a process with no Day tree alive, so its content is snapshotted
at post time as plain strings: a `Notification` cannot bind a signal or a closure.

## 5. Route the tap

`.route("clock/timer")` names the Day route a tap navigates to, the same route strings the
navigation rail and deep links use. The tap is delivered through `day_core::request_route`, which
handles both cases: a warm tap navigates the running app, and a tap that cold-starts the process
is buffered and replayed once routing is live, so the app opens on the target screen.
`capabilities().tap_route` says whether the running platform delivers taps.

## 6. Gate the UI

Query what the platform can do instead of branching on target names:

```rust
let caps = day_part_local_notify::capabilities();
caps.post                 // notifications work at all (shorthand: is_supported())
caps.schedule_while_dead  // the OS holds a schedule across app exit
caps.channels             // a user-facing channel model (Android)
caps.badge                // app-icon badge counts
caps.icon                 // custom small icons (Android)
caps.tap_route            // taps route into the app
caps.schedule_exact       // scheduled fires are on time
```

On the unwired targets every field is false and `post()` returns `NotifyError::Unsupported`, so a
notifications section can hide itself.

## Pitfalls

- Without granted consent, Apple accepts the post and drops it silently. Request
  `Permission::Notifications` first (step 2); `post()` returning `Ok` is not proof of delivery.
- On Android, `Importance::Default` puts the notification in the shade only. Use `Importance::High`
  or `Urgent` for a heads-up banner.
- iOS suppresses a notification posted while the app is frontmost unless a delegate opts in from
  `willPresent`. The crate ships that delegate; it shows the banner, the list entry, and the
  channel's sound, and its `didReceive` delivers taps. If you install your own
  `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`, you take that job over.
- `day launch` runs an unbundled binary, and `UNUserNotificationCenter` does not exist without a
  bundle identifier; the crate reports `Unsupported` rather than crashing. Run `day pack -p
  macos-appkit` and launch the `.app` to see real notifications in the dev loop.
