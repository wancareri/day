Menus, keyboard shortcuts, and toolbars expose an app’s commands through familiar platform
controls. Day uses a shared Rust API to define them, along with secondary windows and a Settings
window. A menu item can call the same action as a button in the interface:

```rust
menu_item("Save").key("s").action(save)     // ⌘S on macOS, Ctrl+S everywhere else
```

**Works on:** context menus render natively everywhere (`NSMenu`, `GtkPopoverMenu`, `QMenu`,
`UIMenu`, Android `PopupMenu`, XAML `MenuFlyout`). The app menu is a menu bar on the four
desktop [backends](/docs/glossary#backend) and the app-bar overflow (⋮) on Android; on iPhone it is a no-op, since
touch platforms have no global menu bar. Toolbars exist only where the platform has them:
`Cap::Toolbar` is `Native` on the four desktop backends and `Unsupported` everywhere else.
Secondary windows work on every backend: native windows on the desktops, iPad, Android, and
HarmonyOS; on iPhone and web the same call presents the content as a fullscreen cover.

## 1. Install the app menu

Call `app_menu` once at startup, with one `sub_menu` per menu-bar menu:

```rust
use day::prelude::*;

app_menu(vec![
    sub_menu("File", vec![
        menu_role(MenuRole::NewWindow),                       // File ▸ New Window, ⌘N (step 5)
        menu_item("Open…").key("o").action(|| open_file()),
        menu_item("Save").key("s").action(|| save()),
        menu_separator(),
        menu_role(MenuRole::CloseWindow),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Quit),
    ])
    .bar_role(MenuBarRole::File),
    sub_menu("Edit", vec![
        menu_role(MenuRole::Undo), menu_role(MenuRole::Redo),
        menu_separator(),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Cut), menu_role(MenuRole::Copy),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Paste), menu_role(MenuRole::SelectAll),
    ])
    .bar_role(MenuBarRole::Edit),
]);
```

- Roles are the platform's items. `menu_role(MenuRole::Copy)` emits the native Edit ▸ Copy:
  correct localized label, default shortcut, automatic enable/disable, and focus targeting, so it
  copies from whatever control has focus with no wiring. Custom `menu_item`s run your closure
  instead.
- `.key("s")` is the primary modifier (⌘ on Apple, Ctrl elsewhere), so one spec reads right on every
  desktop. For anything else, build a `Shortcut`: `Shortcut::new("s").shift()` is ⇧⌘S /
  Ctrl+Shift+S, `Shortcut::plain("Delete")` has no modifier, and `.alt()` / `.control()` add the
  rest. Named keys (`"Return"`, `"Delete"`, `"F5"`, arrows) work alongside single characters.
- `.bar_role(…)` claims a standard slot. Each desktop fills the standard menus (Edit, View, Help)
  with its own stock version for any slot you didn't claim. Tagging your submenu with
  `MenuBarRole::File` / `Edit` / `View` replaces the stock menu in place, in the bar's standard
  order. The tag identifies the slot, not the title; Day's catalog and yours may translate the same
  menu name differently, and a bar matched on titles would show both.

The bar appears in the system menu bar on macOS (Day prepends the standard App menu with
About and Quit, so your submenus start at File), in a bar at the top of the window on GTK and
Windows, in a `QMenuBar` on Qt (the native global bar on `macos-qt`), and in the app-bar
overflow on Android. Android allows one level of submenu; deeper ones flatten.

`app_menu` resolves labels once, in the install-time [locale](/docs/glossary#locale). If your app has a runtime
language picker, install with `app_menu_reactive(builder)` instead; the builder re-runs on a
locale change and reinstalls the bar in the new language.

## 2. Attach context menus

The same entries attach to any [piece](/docs/glossary#piece) with `.context_menu(…)`, shown on secondary-click on
desktop and long-press on touch:

```rust
label("Right-click me").context_menu(vec![
    menu_item("Rename").action(|| rename()),
    menu_item("Duplicate").key("d").action(|| duplicate()),
    menu_separator(),
    menu_role(MenuRole::Copy),
])
```

Submenus nest inside a context menu the same way, `menu_role` items keep their native
behavior, and passing an empty `Vec` removes the menu.

## 3. Put commands in a toolbar

Declare a toolbar on the piece its commands act on, with `.toolbar(…)`. Where you declare an
item is where it appears, and it stays as long as the declaring piece does. Items on the
window's root piece ride every page of that window. Items on a content-list pane ride the
list's column on a desktop and the list's own navigation bar on a phone. Items on a
destination page ride the detail column. A command leaves the bar when the content it acts on
leaves the screen, so one declaration serves every desktop and phone, and there is no
capability to probe first.

```rust
item_list(scene).grow().toolbar([
    toolbar_toggle("show-done", "Show Done", scene.show_done).icon(Symbol::Filter),
    toolbar_button("add", "Add")
        .icon(Symbol::Add)
        .placement(ToolbarPlacement::Primary)
        .action(move || scene.new_item()),
])
```

The items are `toolbar_button(id, label)` for a command, `toolbar_toggle(id, label, signal)`
for a two-state button bound two-way, `toolbar_segmented(id, segments, signal)` for one native
segmented control, `toolbar_menu(id, label, entries)` for a pull-down built from the same
`MenuEntry`s the menu bar takes, `toolbar_label(id, text)` for static text, and
`toolbar_separator()` for a divider. The modifiers are `.icon(Symbol)`, `.image(name)`,
`.action(f)`, `.tooltip(t)`, `.enabled(bool)`, `.enabled_when(f)`, `.placement(…)`,
`.label_style(…)`, and `.prominent()`.

Search has no toolbar item. Declare it on the navigation surface it filters, with
`nav(section).searchable(query)`, and Day draws the field where the platform puts search.
That lets it move into the navigation list on a window too narrow for a [sidebar](/docs/glossary#sidebar) without your code
changing. A sidebar supplies its own toggle button, so an app declares nothing for that either.

Alignment comes from `.placement(…)`, which names the item's role rather than a position in the
list, and each backend lays that role out its own way: `Navigation` sits at the leading edge of its
column, `Principal` is centered, `Primary` and `Secondary` go trailing, with secondaries folding
into an overflow menu first, and `Bottom` asks for a phone's bottom bar. `.icon(Symbol::Refresh)`
names what the icon means; each backend draws its platform's glyph (an SF Symbol on macOS, a
freedesktop name on GTK and Qt, a Segoe Fluent glyph on Windows).

Per desktop, the bar is an `NSToolbar` in the unified title-bar style on macOS, where each
column's items sit over that column; on GTK the items pack into the window's `AdwHeaderBar`,
because in GNOME the header bar is the toolbar; on Qt it is a real `QToolBar` that takes its
icon size and style from the user's settings; on Windows it is a `CommandBar`, whose one limit
is that search fields and labels always render on the leading side.

`.toolbar(…)` also takes a closure, `page.toolbar(move || vec![…])`, which re-runs whenever the
state it reads changes and replaces that piece's items. Keep the values that change often out of
that closure: a toggle's [signal](/docs/glossary#signal), a search field's signal, and
`.enabled_when(…)` patch the one item in place, so a command greying out never disturbs a search in
progress. To show an item conditionally, put its piece under `when`; the item leaves with its
subtree. The [Toolbars](/docs/internal/toolbars) reference covers placement per platform and what
each backend draws.

## 4. Open a secondary window

```rust
let win = day::open_window(
    Some("detail:AAPL"),                  // key: open-or-focus singleton; None = always new
    WindowOptions { title: "AAPL".into(), size: Size::new(720.0, 640.0), ..Default::default() },
    WindowKind::Normal,
    || detail_page("AAPL"),
);
win.on_close(|| println!("gone"));
```

The `key` names the logical window: opening an already-open key focuses it instead of
duplicating, and `day::window_by_key("detail:AAPL")` finds it later. `WindowKind::Normal` is
resizable, miniaturizable, and joins the platform's tabbing group; `WindowKind::Preferences`
drops resize and minimize and never tabs. The window is app-owned: it survives the page that
opened it. Close is asynchronous everywhere: the title-bar button, a platform gesture, and
`WindowHandle::close()` all wait for the platform to confirm, then the content is disposed and
`on_close` runs. Closing the primary window quits the app.

Where the [toolkit](/docs/glossary#toolkit) cannot open windows (iPhone, web, and the `Preferences`
kind on all mobile), the content presents as a fullscreen cover in the primary window instead, with
the same API, keys, and close path. That tier has no native title bar or close button, so probe
`Cap::MultiWindow` and give cover-tier content its own close affordance (the system back button
closes it on Android).

## 5. Add the Settings window and File ▸ New Window

Two registrations in your root builder, before `app_menu`, give the app its standard window
conventions:

```rust
day::register_preferences_with(
    WindowOptions { title: "Settings".into(), size: Size::new(520.0, 420.0), ..Default::default() },
    || preferences_page(),
);
day::register_new_window(|| {
    install_toolbar();      // each window gets its own bar (see Pitfalls)
    shell()
});
```

`register_preferences_with` alone enables the Settings item: on macOS,
"Settings…" with ⌘, in the App menu directly under About; on GTK, Qt, and Windows, a
Preferences item with Ctrl+comma, injected into your first menu if you didn't place a
`menu_role(MenuRole::Preferences)` yourself. The window opens under the singleton key
`day.preferences`, so reopening focuses it, and `day::open_preferences()` opens the same
surface from anywhere, such as a toolbar gear. On the cover tier it presents fullscreen.

`register_new_window` names the builder behind `menu_role(MenuRole::NewWindow)` (File ▸ New
Window with ⌘N/Ctrl+N) and the macOS tab-bar "+". Each call opens an independent `Normal`
window. On macOS, Day also installs the standard Window menu (Minimize, Zoom, Bring All to
Front, plus the open-window list) unless your own menu claims `MenuRole::Minimize`.

## Pitfalls

- Register windows before the menu. A `MenuRole::NewWindow` item lowers disabled when no
  builder is registered, and the auto Settings item needs the preferences registration. Call
  `register_preferences_with` and `register_new_window` before installing the app menu (the
  showcase's `root()` does exactly this), so the items lower live.
- Toolbars follow their pieces into new windows. Items declared on the root piece a
  `register_new_window` builder returns ride that window, and a page's items ride it wherever
  the page is shown. A builder whose pieces declare none opens a window with an empty bar.
- Keep bound values out of a derived toolbar closure. A [reactive](/docs/glossary#reactive) rebuild replaces that
  piece's items and would drop the search field's focus mid-word. Structure and labels go in
  the closure; a toggle's signal, a search signal, and `.enabled_when` patch single items.
- Don't put the toolkit name in your window title. Debug builds append a
  `(<version>/<toolkit>)` tag to every title so you can tell windows apart; add your own and
  it appears twice. Release builds never show the tag.
