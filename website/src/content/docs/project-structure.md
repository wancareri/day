A Day project combines a Cargo package, a `Day.toml` app manifest, and platform host projects.
Rust code defines the app’s shared behavior; the host projects provide the files needed by
Xcode, Gradle, and other platform build tools. The CLI builds them from the layout below.

## The conventional project

```text
my-app/
├── Day.toml                  # the app manifest: id, title, targets, window (name/version come from Cargo.toml)
├── Cargo.toml                # a normal Cargo package (bin + rlib)

├── platform/

```

- `Day.toml` is the single manifest. The app's Day-specific identity (`id`, `title`, `artifact`,
  `build`), its declared `targets`, the default window geometry, and the `[permissions]`,
  `[signing]`, and `[sbom]` sections live here, while `name` and `version` are derived from
  Cargo.toml's `[package]`, so they can never drift. The identity properties (`id`, `title`,
  `artifact`, `build`) can be overridden per platform (`[app.ios]`), per
  [toolkit](/docs/glossary#toolkit) (`[app.qt]`), or per target (`[app.macos-appkit]`); the platform
  scaffolds read the resolved values at build time.
- The scaffolds are host projects. `platform/ios`, `platform/android`, and `platform/ohos` contain no
  app logic. Each is a minimal native shell that loads the Rust library and hands it the root view.
  They rarely change.
- Generated files are written to `build/day/`: Cargo target directories (one per target and profile,
  so parallel builds never contend), staged resources, packed artifacts, and
  [dayscript](/docs/glossary#dayscript) screenshots all live under one ignorable directory.

## How a build works

Every target follows the same shape. `day build -p <target>` (or `launch`, which builds first)
stages resources, selects the toolkit feature, and runs the platform's build system for
anything native:

```text
day build -p <target>
│
├── 1. stage resources          resource/images + resource/assets → the target's native store
│                               (actool / aapt2 / GResource / .qrc / rawfile — see below)
│
├── 2. select features          --features <toolkit> + every standalone piece's
│                               <piece>/<toolkit> renderer feature (from cargo metadata)
│
└── 3. platform build
    ├── desktop   cargo build            → the app binary is the artifact
    ├── ios       xcodebuild             → Runner.app  (links the cargo staticlib)
    ├── android   cargo-ndk + gradle     → app.apk     (bundles the cargo cdylib)
    └── harmony   cargo + hvigor + sign  → app.hap     (bundles the cargo cdylib)
```

One [backend](/docs/glossary#backend) is compiled per binary. The AppKit build contains no GTK code, the Android build only
its JNI bridge. Standalone [pieces](/docs/glossary#piece) (say, a Lottie or map piece) contribute their own native code and
dependencies through Cargo metadata, so the app never re-declares per-piece build wiring.

### Desktop: `macos-appkit`, `linux-gtk`, `linux-qt`, `windows-xaml`, and the GTK/Qt combinations

Desktop targets are the simplest: the artifact is the Cargo binary itself.

```text
src/*.rs ──► cargo build -p my-app --features appkit     (per-target CARGO_TARGET_DIR)
                 │
                 ├── GTK: links system GTK 4 / libadwaita
                 ├── Qt / XAML: cc-compiled C++ shim (built by the toolkit crate's build.rs)
                 ├── XAML: embeds a side-by-side manifest (XAML Islands requires it)
                 └── macos-appkit: swift build prepass when Swift is contributed
                     (build/day/macos/DayPieces, statically linked — docs/swiftui)
                 ▼
         build/day/cargo/<target>/<profile>/my-app      ◄── day launch runs this directly
                 ▼
         day pack: macOS .app + ad-hoc codesign + .dmg
```

Because GTK and Qt are portable, `macos-gtk`, `macos-qt`, `windows-gtk`, and `windows-qt` build the
same way on their respective hosts. Resources that need a native compiler (GResource, `.qrc`) are
compiled if the tool is on `PATH` and otherwise fall back to filesystem loading, so a missing
`glib-compile-resources` never fails the build.

### iOS: `ios-uikit`

The Xcode project owns the bundle; the Rust code arrives as a static library through a build-phase
callback into the `day` CLI:

```text
day build -p ios-uikit
│
├── generate DayPieces           a local SwiftPM package assembled from every piece's
│                                [package.metadata.day.ios]: Swift shims, SwiftPM deps
│                                (remote or local packages), system frameworks, and the
│                                platform floor. A local package's public SwiftUI views
│                                are scanned and exported as crate::swiftui::… bindings;
│                                [package.metadata.day.macos] is the appkit twin
│
└── xcodebuild  platform/ios/DayApp.xcodeproj  (Runner target, iphonesimulator arm64)
        │
        ├── script phase: "day xcode-backend build"
        │       └── cargo rustc --crate-type staticlib --target aarch64-apple-ios-sim
        │           → libmy_app.a, linked into Runner
        ├── actool: resource/images → Media.xcassets → optimized Assets.car
        └── Swift Runner: loads the Day root view, hands control to Rust
        ▼
build/day/ios-uikit/Debug-iphonesimulator/MyApp.app
        ▼
xcrun simctl install booted … && simctl launch          (day launch)
```

The callback design means opening `platform/ios` in Xcode and pressing Run also works, because the
build phase calls back into `day` for the Rust half.

### Android: `android-mdc`

On Android, `day` runs Cargo first, then hands Gradle a project whose source sets already point at
everything Day staged:

```text
day build -p android-mdc
│
├── cargo-ndk (arm64-v8a) ────────► build/day/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmy_app.so
│
├── piece discovery ──────────────► build/day/android/day-pieces.json
│                                   (each piece's Java dirs, Gradle deps, Maven repos,
│                                    manifest permissions — read generically by the scaffold)
│
└── gradle assembleDebug   platform/android/
        │
        ├── sourceSets: the day-android Java shim + piece Java + jniLibs + assets/
        ├── aapt2: staged resource/images → res/drawable* → R.drawable ids
        └── Material 3 theme + DayActivity host (loads the .so, calls nativeStart)
        ▼
platform/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
        ▼
adb install … && am start DayActivity                   (day launch)
```

The Gradle scaffold also calls back (`day gradle-backend build`) so a build started from Android
Studio rebuilds the Rust `.so` the same way.

### HarmonyOS: `harmony-arkui`

The newest pipeline follows the Android shape with HarmonyOS tooling: an ArkTS host project in
`platform/ohos/`, a cross-compiled NAPI library, and a post-build signing step with the public
OpenHarmony development certificate:

```text
day build -p harmony-arkui
│
├── cargo rustc --crate-type cdylib --target x86_64-unknown-linux-ohos   (emulator; arm64 device)
│       linker = $OHOS_NDK_HOME/llvm/bin/<triple>-clang
│       ────────► platform/ohos/entry/libs/<abi>/libentry.so
│
├── hvigor assembleHap   platform/ohos/   (ohpm install first)
│       ├── compiles the ArkTS host (Index.ets mounts Day via a NodeContent slot)
│       ├── packs libentry.so + resources/rawfile/day/ (staged images & assets)
│       └── → entry-default-unsigned.hap
│
└── sign-hap.mjs         patch compileSdkType → "OpenHarmony", sign with the SDK's
        │                public release material (no developer account required)
        ▼
platform/ohos/entry/build/…/my-app-signed.hap
        ▼
hdc install … && aa start EntryAbility                  (day launch)
```

### Web: `web-dom`

This is the shortest of the five pipelines, and the only one with no host project to check in. The
app's lib crate is compiled straight to wasm and dropped next to the host page:

```text
day build -p web-dom
│
├── cargo rustc --crate-type cdylib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
│       exports day_dom_main (via day::day_start_web!)
│       ────────► dist/app.wasm
│
├── the host trio, embedded in the CLI and written out verbatim
│       ────────► dist/index.html · dist/shim.js · dist/day.css
│
└── bundled images and fonts + a fonts.json manifest the shim preloads
        ────────► dist/assets/…
                        ▼
              dist/ is the deployable — copy it to any static host
                        ▼
day launch -p web-dom   serves dist/ over loopback and opens your browser
```

There is no `day pack` for this target: `dist/` is already the artifact. Browsers refuse to
instantiate WebAssembly from `file:`, so use `day launch` (or any static server) rather than
opening `index.html` directly.

## How resources are packaged

`resource/images/` and `resource/assets/` are looked up by name at runtime through the generated
typed constants (`image(res::images::logo)`, `resource(res::assets::stations_json)`; a typo is a
compile error). Before each platform build Day stages the files, unchanged, into that target's
native resource store, so the platform's machinery does the optimizing, and the runtime read is
native (and zero-copy wherever the store exposes a stable pointer):

```text
                        day build -p <target>
                                 │  stage
      ┌──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┐
      ▼                          ▼                              ▼
   resource/images/logo.png   resource/assets/stations.json resource/icons/
      │                          │                              │
      │ per-target store         │ per-target store             │ dock / taskbar /
      │                          │                              │ launcher icon
┌─────┴──────────────────┐ ┌─────┴─────────────────────┐        │

│ ArkUI    rawfile       │ └───────────┬───────────────┘
└─────┬──────────────────┘             │
      ▼                                ▼
 image(res::images::logo)      resource(res::assets::stations_json)
 native by-name lookup         zero-copy &[u8] view, random access
```

At runtime, `resource()` returns a `Resource` backed directly by that store:

```rust
let res = day::resource(res::assets::stations_json).expect("bundled");
let bytes: &[u8] = res.as_slice();   // zero-copy view into the native store
let mut header = [0u8; 16];
res.read_at(0, &mut header);         // random access, no allocation
```

On Apple platforms that view is an `mmap` of the bundle file; on Android it is the NDK
`AAssetManager` buffer of an uncompressed asset; GTK and Qt read out of resource blobs compiled
into the binary; ArkUI maps the `rawfile` descriptor. Images resolve through each platform's
by-name API (`UIImage(named:)`, `R.drawable`, `gtk_picture_new_for_resource`, `QPixmap(":/…")`,
`resource://RAWFILE/…`), so density variants like `logo@2x.png` map onto the platform's own
scale-selection mechanism.

[Fluent](/docs/glossary#fluent) translations under `resource/locales/` take a different path: they
are embedded into the binary at compile time with `include_str!`, so [locale](/docs/glossary#locale)
switching never touches the filesystem.

The full per-platform details, including the limits (what gets optimized where, and which stores
allow zero-copy), are in the [resources reference](/docs/internal/resources); the HarmonyOS
pipeline has its own [reference page](/docs/internal/harmonyos).
