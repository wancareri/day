The pages linked here are the framework's internal reference documentation, published as-is from
the repository's `docs/` directory. They're terser than the guides (per-API detail, per-platform
support tables, edge cases), and they're the same files Day's own developers keep current, so
they tend to lead the guides when something changes. For the words themselves, the
[Glossary](/docs/glossary) defines each term the guides use and names the page that introduces it.
