Day exposes build and app-testing commands through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing
an AI coding agent to edit, run, and inspect an app. This guide uses
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to add a weather page, test it with
[dayscript](/docs/dayscript), and run the tests in CI. The workflow uses a terminal;
[Getting started](/docs/getting-started) covers editor options.

## 0. Install the two CLIs

```bash
cargo install day-cli        # the day CLI (see getting-started for toolkit prerequisites)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
day doctor                   # confirms your desktop toolkit is ready
```

## 1. Scaffold the app

```bash
day new app skycheck --toolkit macos-appkit --no-input
cd skycheck
day launch -p macos-appkit
```

You get a running native app with adaptive navigation, an editable list, localized strings, a
dayscript walkthrough (`dayscript/demo.yaml`), and an `AGENTS.md` that teaches
any coding agent the project's conventions: where pages live, how routes register, that every
control gets a stable `.id()`, and that new strings go into *every* locale.

## 2. Give Claude Code the day tools

```bash
claude mcp add day -- day --project . mcp-server
claude
```

`day mcp-server` (docs: [agent surface](/docs/internal/agent)) exposes ten tools:
`day_metadata`, `day_build`, `day_launch`, `day_relaunch`, `day_drive`, `day_screenshot`, and
friends. The two this loop depends on are `day_relaunch`, which returns compile errors *inside
the tool result* so the agent can correct the error and retry, and `day_drive`, whose screenshots
come back as images the agent can read.

## 3. Add a weather page, by prompt

In the Claude Code session:

> Add a "weather" page to the sidebar: a city picker (Lisbon, Nairobi, Osaka), a large
> temperature label, a one-line conditions label, and a Refresh button that simulates a reload
> with day::sleep. Use demo data, no network. Give every control a stable id
> (weather-city, weather-temp, weather-conditions, weather-refresh), localize every string in
> all locales, then relaunch and show me a screenshot of the page.

Watch the loop the scaffolded `AGENTS.md` prescribes: `day_metadata` first, then the edits, a
`day_relaunch` (fixing anything the compiler says), then a `day_drive` that navigates to the
page and returns a screenshot. The generated page uses the standard Day API. An abbreviated version
should look like this:

```rust
pub(crate) fn weather_page() -> impl Piece {
    let city = Signal::new(0usize);
    let cities = ["Lisbon", "Nairobi", "Osaka"]; // res::str keys in the real page
    let temps = ["18 °C", "24 °C", "11 °C"];
    column((
        label(crate::res::str::weather_title()).font(Font::Title).id("weather-title"),
        picker(cities.iter().cloned(), city).id("weather-city"),
        label(move || temps[city.get()].to_string())
            .font(Font::LargeTitle)
            .id("weather-temp"),
        // …conditions label, and a Refresh button whose action is
        // day::task(async move { day::sleep(600).await; /* set signals */ })
    ))
    .spacing(12.0)
    .padding(16.0)
}
```

If the result isn't right, say so in the same session ("the temperature should update when the
city changes") and the agent re-drives the app to show the fix. Every claim comes back with a
screenshot.

## 4. Script it: dayscript

Now put that verification in a script that CI can rerun. Ask the agent to write it, or drop
this in as `dayscript/weather.yaml`:

```yaml
flow:
  - wait_for: { id: nav }
  - navigate: { route: weather }
  - assert_route: { route: weather }
  - assert_visible: { id: weather-title }

  # The picker drives a signal; the labels read it; assert the round trip.
  - select: { id: weather-city, index: 1 }
  - assert_text: { id: weather-temp, text: "24 °C" }
  - tap: { id: weather-refresh }
  - assert_visible: { id: weather-conditions }

  - screenshot: weather
```

```bash
day launch -p macos-appkit --script dayscript/weather.yaml
day launch -p macos-appkit --script dayscript/weather.yaml --variant dark --env DAY_THEME=dark
day launch -p macos-appkit --script dayscript/weather.yaml --variant fr --locale fr
```

Each run drives the real app and writes content-checked captures under
`build/day/screenshots/<target>/<variant>/`, the same mechanism that produces the localized
[gallery](/gallery) on this site. For strings that vary by locale, assert by Fluent key
(`assert_text: { id: …, key: … }`) instead of literal text and one script passes in every
language.

You can also record the script instead of writing it:
`day launch -p macos-appkit --record dayscript/weather.yaml` captures your real taps, typing, and
navigation into a replayable dayscript while you use the app, rewriting the file continuously so
it survives a kill. Recording a manual walkthrough is the fastest way to get a first script; add
the `assert_*` steps by hand afterward.

## 5. Put it in CI

A minimal GitHub workflow that builds the app headlessly on Linux and runs
the script on every push:

```yaml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  walkthrough:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
            libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev pkg-config xvfb
      - run: cargo install day-cli
      - name: Drive the app
        run: |
          xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1000x720x24" \
            day launch -p linux-gtk --script dayscript/weather.yaml
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: screenshots
          path: build/day/screenshots
```

A failed assertion is a red build; the uploaded captures show reviewers what the app
looked like. From here, add targets to the matrix as your app grows (`day new`'s scaffold works
unchanged on all twelve), or adopt the fuller multi-platform workflow Day itself publishes in
[`daybrite/actions`](https://github.com/daybrite/actions).

- [Testing with dayscript](/docs/dayscript) — the full step catalog and how the engine works.
- [For AI agents](/docs/for-agents) — the terse rulebook agents should follow (link it from
  your own prompts).
- [Agent surface reference](/docs/internal/agent) — `day drive`, sessions, and the MCP tools in
  detail.
