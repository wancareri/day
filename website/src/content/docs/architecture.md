This page lists the crates, explains where their boundaries sit, and shows how a build runs on each
platform. The companion page, [How rendering works](/docs/rendering), follows a widget through the
running system.

   day-cli (the `day` binary)   day-script (dayscript engine, compiled into apps)
   day-build (each app's build.rs: typed resource constants, SwiftUI bindings)
```

Support crates omitted from the diagram: `day-fonts` and `day-vector` (shared resource rules the
CLI and runtime agree on), `day-toolchain` (SDK discovery), `day-break` (crash reporting), and
`day-lite` (JS/TS miniapps).

`day-spec` is the boundary between portable and platform code: it defines the `Toolkit` trait and
the descriptor types (`LabelProps`, `ButtonPatch`, events, …) that flow across it. `day-core` is
written against that trait and monomorphized over the concrete backend, so core code calls native
operations directly. Everything above `day-spec` is portable; everything below it is one platform's
business.

Around the core sit the extension surfaces: [`pieces/day-piece-*`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces) crates add widgets
([extension model](/docs/extending)), [`parts/day-part-*`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/parts) add headless capabilities
([parts](/docs/parts)), and `day-mock` is a full Toolkit implementation with no display, used by
tests.

## One binary per target

A Day binary contains exactly one backend, selected by a Cargo feature at compile time. The
backend is chosen when the binary is built, so the AppKit build contains only AppKit code, and
a call like "set this label's text" compiles down to the backend's concrete function.

The cost is that n [targets](/docs/glossary#target) mean n compilations (CI budgets around it; your laptop builds one at
a time), and a Linux app ships as a GTK build or a Qt build rather than one binary that picks at
runtime. The benefit is that a widget update compiles to a direct call into the one linked
backend, and dead-code elimination works on whole [toolkits](/docs/glossary#toolkit).

The same idea extends to [piece](/docs/glossary#piece) renderers: backends expose a link-time registry (a `linkme`
distributed slice), and each piece crate's renderer registers into it during linking. Startup
iterates the slice once to build the [kind](/docs/glossary#kind) → renderer table. Registration failures are link
errors, not runtime surprises. The one exception is `day-dom`: `linkme` has no wasm32
implementation, so the web backend keeps a runtime registry that pieces register into from
their constructors.

## How a build works

`day build -p <target>` orchestrates; platform tools do the platform work. Most desktop targets
are plain cargo builds (each target gets its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, so parallel target builds
never contend); the exception is `macos-appkit`, which builds through its `platform/macos/`
Xcode host project like a mobile target — including any macOS Swift a dependency contributes,
the [SwiftUI embedding](/docs/internal/swiftui) path. Mobile targets invert control with the **callback pattern**, borrowed
from Flutter: the checked-in platform project drives, and calls back into `day` for the Rust
part, so building from Xcode/Android Studio and building from the CLI produce identical results
and neither goes stale.

```text
 day build -p ios-uikit                    day build -p android-mdc
──────────────────────────                ─────────────────────────────

   │  generates DayPieces SwiftPM pkg        │  cargo-ndk → libapp.so per ABI
   │  (piece Swift shims + deps)             │  writes day-pieces.json (piece java/
   ▼                                         │  gradle deps/permissions) + app props
 xcodebuild ──► "Build Rust (day)" phase     ▼
   │            calls `day xcode-backend    gradle ──► reads the generated files,
   │            build` → cargo staticlib     │         stages jniLibs, merges manifests
   ▼            for the iOS triple           ▼
 Runner.app  ◄── links libapp.a            app-debug.apk
```

The same shape covers OpenHarmony (hvigor builds the ArkTS host around a cross-compiled
`libentry.so`), and `macos-appkit` generates its own `DayPieces` SwiftPM package (at
`build/day/macos/DayPieces`), referenced by the `platform/macos/`
Xcode host project. Metadata flows one way: [`Day.toml`](/docs/glossary#day-toml) (identity) and the Cargo
`version` are conveyed into generated, gitignored files that the checked-in projects read; the
scaffolds themselves are never edited by tooling. [Project structure](/docs/project-structure) documents every directory;
[Packaging](/docs/packaging) covers the signed-artifact pipeline built on top.

## How each backend reaches its toolkit

Each backend crosses into its toolkit using the narrowest viable mechanism:

| Backend | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| AppKit / UIKit | `objc2` bindings: Rust calls the Objective-C runtime directly, no shim |
| GTK | `gtk4-rs` (gobject bindings) |
| Qt | a small hand-written C++ shim (`day-qt-sys`) compiled by `cc` at build time; Rust calls its C API |
| XAML | same pattern with C++/WinRT (`day-xaml-sys`) |
| Android | JNI plus a small Java bridge class shipped with the framework; Rust holds `GlobalRef`s to widgets |
| ArkUI | the ArkUI NDK C API (`day-arkui-sys`) |
| DOM | a wasm32 `extern "C"` boundary implemented by a small JS shim the CLI embeds in the page |

Each shim creates widgets, sets properties, and forwards events. Layout, reactivity, and update
policy live on the shared Rust side, so a new backend is a small amount of code.

## Where the CLI fits

`day-cli` is a separate binary with no dependency on the UI crates. Its jobs: scaffolding
(`day new`), orchestration (`build`/`launch` across targets in parallel, streaming prefixed
logs), diagnosis (`doctor`, with per-toolkit probes and fix-it text), validation (`lint`),
distribution (`pack`, `sign`), and the plumbing subcommands the platform builds call back into.
It's built in the flutter_tools mold: services behind injectable traits for testability, a
stable JSON event stream (`--format json`), and documented exit codes, so scripts and CI
consume the same interface people do.
