An app's `Cargo.toml` resolves the framework from git:

```toml
[dependencies]
day = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" }
```

CI and anyone who clones the app build from that git source. When you are changing a day crate and
the app screen that demonstrates it, the app has to build against your checkout instead; `day patch`
makes the switch:

```sh
cd my-app
day patch --local ../day     # build against the checkout at ../day
day patch --check            # verify: no day crate resolves from git

# More than one checkout: day and an external piece you are changing together. Each is
# recognized by what it carries (the `day` crate, or its manifest's `repository`).
day patch --local ../day --local ../day-piece-lottie

# A fork of day, for good: a committable table that redirects the canonical URL for the
# whole graph, so external pieces build against the fork too, unchanged.
day patch --git https://github.com/acme/day.git@acme
rm .cargo/config.toml        # back to the git dependency
```

### Trying a version for one build

`day patch` changes the project until you undo it. To build against another version once (to check
whether a branch fixes a bug, say), pass `--day-src` to `day build` or `day launch` instead:

```sh
day launch --day-src ../day                                               # a local checkout
day launch --day-src https://github.com/daybrite/day.git@experimental-nav  # a branch
day launch --day-src https://github.com/someone/day.git@fix-482            # a PR fork
```

It computes the same `[patch]` table, hands it to that one cargo run, and leaves the project as it
found it: cargo rewrites `Cargo.lock` during the build and the CLI restores after it. A git URL is
cloned into the shared cache and cached per ref, so a second look at the same branch skips the
clone.

Each day-src also gets its own build tree, so you can leave two versions of the app running at
once and switching between them is an incremental compile. In a debug build the window titles say
which is which: `Day Rise (0.1.0+main-2d77edbf/appkit)` beside
`Day Rise (0.1.0+experimental-nav-9f8e7d6c/appkit)`.
[CLI & projects](/docs/cli#trying-another-version-of-day-itself) has the full flag.

Reach for `day patch` when you're working on the framework and the app together over a session,
and `--day-src` when you're comparing.

## What it writes

`day patch --local <checkout>` writes the app's `.cargo/config.toml` with a Cargo
[`[patch]` table](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html)
mapping every day crate in the app's dependency graph to a path inside the checkout:

```toml
[patch."https://github.com/daybrite/day.git"]
day = { path = "/home/you/src/day/crates/day" }
day-android = { path = "/home/you/src/day/toolkits/day-android" }
# … one entry per day crate the app resolves
```

The file is machine-local and stays out of git; the scaffold's `.gitignore` covers it, and
CI resolves the git dependency exactly as a user's build would. Delete the file to switch
back.

Writing that table by hand is risky because a missing entry does not fail: cargo resolves the
missing crate from its git cache, and the build mixes your checkout with a published release, so
part of it is not the code you are editing. The table is also hard to keep right:

- The crate set is bigger than the app's manifest. Toolkit backends like `day-android` reach
  the app through the `day` umbrella crate's per-target dependency tables, so the app never
  names them. `day patch` resolves the full graph for every platform Day targets, with every
  backend feature on, and patches whatever it finds.
- The crate set changes. Add a `day-part-*` dependency, or pull in a new framework crate,
  and a hand-maintained table is out of date, with no error to tell you so.

After writing the table, the command verifies it: it asks cargo for the resolved graph of
every platform and fails if any `day*` crate still comes from git.

Cargo treats a `[patch]` entry as a resolution candidate and selects the newest compatible
version. If the local checkout has a lower version than the Git dependency, Cargo may select
the Git dependency instead. The check reports both versions. Update the local checkout if
you intend to build against the latest source. To build against an older commit on purpose, lock the app to it first
(`cargo update -p day --precise <commit>`) and patch again: a locked dependency whose version
matches its patch resolves to the patch without asking upstream.

## Working on the framework and an app in parallel

This is the workflow for adding a feature to a day crate alongside its demonstration in an
app. [Day-Showcase](https://github.com/daybrite/Day-Showcase) is the framework's example
of the pattern (every new piece and part includes a showcase screen that exercises it),
but any app works the same way.

1. **Patch once.** In the app, run `day patch --local <path-to-day>`. Every later build
   compiles the framework from the checkout: edit a day crate, re-run `day launch` (or
   `day relaunch`), and the change is in the app, with cargo's usual incremental rebuild.
2. **Develop both sides.** Change the framework crate, change the app's screen, build,
   repeat. There is no publish step in the loop.
3. **Re-run `day patch` when the crate set changes.** A new day dependency in the app's
   `Cargo.toml`, or a new crate in the framework workspace that the app pulls in, needs a
   new table entry. Re-running the command rewrites the whole table.
4. **Land the framework change first.** The app's git dependency names no revision, and a
   scaffolded app commits no `Cargo.lock`, so CI and fresh clones resolve day's current
   `main`. Once the framework side merges, the app change builds everywhere; land it second.
5. **Unpatch when you are done, or leave it.** `rm .cargo/config.toml` returns the app to the
   git dependency. On a machine where you always develop against the checkout, leaving it in
   place is fine: git ignores the file, so it affects no one else.

`day patch --check` is the guard for step 4 and for CI. It writes nothing and exits non-zero
if any day crate in any platform's graph still resolves from git. Day's CI checks out
Day-Showcase, locks it to the commit under test, points it at that checkout, and runs
exactly this check before building, so a green showcase build means the showcase built
against that commit, with nothing resolved from the git cache.

## What not to commit

- `.cargo/config.toml` — machine-local absolute paths. The scaffold gitignores it.
- `Cargo.lock` — a scaffolded Day app gitignores this too. A lock resolved while patched
  records the checkout's paths, which mean nothing on another machine, and an unpatched lock
  pins a git revision that falls behind a floating `main`.

If your app does commit its lockfile, regenerate it unpatched (delete `.cargo/config.toml`,
then run `cargo update`) before committing.
