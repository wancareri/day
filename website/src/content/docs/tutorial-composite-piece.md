Most Day widgets you build are **composite pieces**: new widgets assembled from primitives Day
already ships. A composite piece is pure Rust in an ordinary library crate. You add it to an app
as a dependency. Its platform support depends on the pieces it uses; composition itself
requires no additional native backend.

In this tutorial you will build a complete example: a **star rating** control, a row of tappable stars
bound to a `Signal<usize>`. By the end you will have a `day-piece-rating` crate you can `.max(5)`,
`.star_size(32.0)`, and drop next to a label, just like a built-in.

## 1. What a composite piece is (and why it needs no backend code)

Day has two kinds of pieces:

| | **Native piece** | **Composite piece** |
|---|---|---|
| What it wraps | a *new* native control (`NSComboBox`, `WKWebView`, …) | *existing* Day pieces |
| Per-toolkit code | one renderer per backend (Obj-C, C++, Java…) | none |
| Cargo features | `appkit` / `gtk` / `qt` / `uikit` / `mdc` / `xaml` | none |
| Extra build assets | `build.rs`, shims, Gradle/SwiftPM entries | none |
| Reference | [the native-piece tutorial](/docs/tutorial-native-piece) · `day-piece-searchfield` | this tutorial · `day-piece-rating` |

A native piece exists to introduce a native widget Day does not already have. A star rating is a
row of small drawings that react to taps, and Day already gives you `row`, `canvas` (a native 2D
surface on every platform), `Shape`, `Signal`, and `.on_tap`. Compose those and the existing leaves
do the platform work: the AppKit build draws the star with Core Graphics, the Android build with
`android.graphics.Canvas`, and the GTK build with Cairo, all from the one `canvas` closure.

Most widgets should be composite. Reach for a native piece only when you need a control the
toolkits provide and Day does not yet wrap.

The composition toolkit lives in the prelude:

- `column` / `row` / `zstack`: stack children (vertical, horizontal, layered).
- `.overlay(...)` / `.overlay_aligned(align, ...)` with `Alignment`: draw an annotation on top
  without changing layout size (badges, corner dots).
- `.background(color)` / `.corner_radius(r)` / `.padding(...)` / `.frame(w, h)`: surface + inset.
- `canvas(|d, size| …)` with `Shape`: a native drawing surface for anything custom.
- the `Modifier` trait + `.modifier(m)`: a reusable, by-value view transform (a card, a chip).
- `ButtonStyle` / `FilledButtonStyle` + `Button::style`: a pluggable button appearance.
- `with_environment(...)` / `environment::<T>()`: pass ambient values down a subtree.

## 2. Scaffold the crate

Start with the scaffolder. `day new piece` generates a ready-to-build crate (`Cargo.toml`,
`.gitignore`, `README.md`, and a sample `src/lib.rs`):

```bash
day new piece day-piece-rating          # no --toolkits ⇒ a composite piece
```

The generated crate builds immediately (`cargo build`) and depends on a remote Day release, so it
works as a standalone repo outside the Day workspace. Pass `--id dev.acme.rating` to set the
reverse-DNS id (defaults to `dev.example.<name>`), or `--local <path-to-day-checkout>` if you are
developing against a local Day clone rather than the published crates. `--composite` forces a
composite piece even when `--toolkits` is present, and `--no-input` skips the interactive prompts
(scripts and CI). The rest of this tutorial walks
through what the scaffolder emits and how to flesh it out.

A composite piece is an ordinary library crate. It depends on three Day crates and nothing
platform-specific.

```toml
# day-piece-rating/Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "day-piece-rating"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[dependencies]
# The framework crates come from git until they're on crates.io (`day new piece` writes this).
day-pieces = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" }   # primitives + prelude (row, canvas, Decorate, …)
day-core = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" }     # Piece / BuildCx / RNode / AnyPiece
day-reactive = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" } # Signal (also re-exported through day-pieces' prelude)

# Note what is not here: no [features], no dep:day-appkit / day-gtk / day-android,
# no build.rs. A composed piece needs no per-toolkit code at all.

# The scaffolder appends this so the crate is its own cargo workspace and builds standalone.
[workspace]
```

> [!NOTE] Inside the Day workspace
> These are `{ workspace = true }` instead of a version. A native piece's `Cargo.toml` also
> carries a `[features]` block (one feature per backend) and often a `build.rs`; see
> [the native-piece tutorial](/docs/tutorial-native-piece).

Now `src/lib.rs`. Everything comes from the pieces prelude; `RNode` also comes from `day-core`,
because it is the return type of `Piece::build`:

```rust
use day_core::RNode;
use day_pieces::prelude::*;
```

## 3. Design the builder

Day pieces follow a **config-struct + chainable-setter** pattern (the same shape as `slider(...)`,
`button(...)`, or the `combo_box` piece). A free function creates the piece with defaults; methods
return `Self` so calls chain. The two-way value is a `Signal` passed in by the caller: the control
reads it to draw and writes it back on tap.

```rust
/// The default filled-star tint: a warm gold/amber.
const GOLD: Color = Color::rgb(1.0, 0.72, 0.0);

/// A star-rating control bound to `value` (the number of filled stars).
pub struct Rating {
    value: Signal<usize>,
    max: u32,
    star_size: f64,
    editable: bool,
    color: Color,
}

/// Create a rating bound to `value`. Defaults: 5 stars, 28pt, tappable, gold.
pub fn rating(value: Signal<usize>) -> Rating {
    Rating {
        value,
        max: 5,
        star_size: 28.0,
        editable: true,
        color: GOLD,
    }
}

impl Rating {
    /// How many stars to show (clamped to at least 1; default 5).
    pub fn max(mut self, n: u32) -> Self {
        self.max = n.max(1);
        self
    }
    /// Edge length of each star, in points (default 28).
    pub fn star_size(mut self, pt: f64) -> Self {
        self.star_size = pt;
        self
    }
    /// Whether taps change the value (default `true`; pass `false` for a read-only display).
    pub fn editable(mut self, yes: bool) -> Self {
        self.editable = yes;
        self
    }
    /// The star tint (default gold).
    pub fn color(mut self, c: Color) -> Self {
        self.color = c;
        self
    }
}
```

The shipped crate also has an inherent `.id(prefix)` setter. A rating is several tappable nodes
rather than one, so a plain `Decorate::id` would tag only the row and leave the stars
unaddressable; `.id(prefix)` sets the row's id to `prefix` and each star's to `prefix:N`
(1-based), so a dayscript walkthrough can `tap` a specific star.

## 4. Compose the body

A piece becomes usable by implementing the `Piece` trait: a single `build` method that returns the
node it created. Once `Rating` implements `Piece`, it automatically gains `.id(…)`, `.padding(…)`,
`.frame(…)`, `.any()` and the rest, from the blanket `Decorate` impl.

### The star, as a `Shape::Polygon`

A five-pointed star is ten points on two alternating radii: a tip on the outer radius, a valley on
the inner one. This helper computes them, centered in whatever size layout hands the canvas:

```rust
/// Vertices of an `points`-pointed star centered in `size`, first tip pointing up.
fn star_points(size: Size, points: usize, outer: f64, inner: f64) -> Vec<Point> {
    let cx = size.width / 2.0;
    let cy = size.height / 2.0;
    let step = std::f64::consts::PI / points as f64; // half-sector: tip → valley
    let mut angle = -std::f64::consts::FRAC_PI_2;     // start at the top
    let mut out = Vec::with_capacity(points * 2);
    for i in 0..points * 2 {
        let r = if i % 2 == 0 { outer } else { inner };
        out.push(Point::new(cx + r * angle.cos(), cy + r * angle.sin()));
        angle += step;
    }
    out
}
```

### One star = one reactive `canvas`

Each star is a fixed-size `canvas` that draws the polygon: filled if its index is within the
current value, outlined otherwise. The draw closure reads `value.get()`, a tracked read, so
the canvas re-records exactly when the signal changes. When `editable`, an `.on_tap` writes this
star's 1-based position back into the signal.

```rust
fn star(i: usize, value: Signal<usize>, size_pt: f64, editable: bool, color: Color) -> AnyPiece {
    let star = canvas(move |d, size| {
        let radius = size.width.min(size.height) / 2.0 - 1.0; // 1pt margin for the stroke
        let shape = Shape::Polygon(star_points(size, 5, radius, radius * 0.42));
        if i < value.get() {
            d.fill(shape, color); // selected → solid
        } else {
            d.stroke(shape, color, 1.5); // empty → outline
        }
    })
    .frame(size_pt, size_pt);

    if editable {
        star.on_tap(move || value.set(i + 1))
    } else {
        star
    }
}
```

### The body: a `row` of stars

`build` lays the stars in a `row`. Because the count is dynamic, collect them into a `PieceVec`
(the runtime-heterogeneous child sequence) and hand that to `row`:

```rust
impl Piece for Rating {
    fn build(self, cx: &mut BuildCx) -> RNode {
        let Rating { value, max, star_size, editable, color } = self;
        let stars: Vec<AnyPiece> =
            (0..max as usize).map(|i| star(i, value, star_size, editable, color)).collect();
        row(PieceVec(stars)).spacing(4.0).build(cx)
    }
}
```

That completes the piece. The row and its `max` canvases are built once. Tapping the third star
calls `value.set(3)`; only the star canvases that read `value` re-record (the first three fill, the
last two outline), and `build` never runs again. This is Day's build-once reactive model; the
tracked read in the `canvas` closure is the only binding.

## 5. Use it in an app

The app depends on `day-piece-rating` like any crate, with one line in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# the app's Cargo.toml (the framework crates come from git until they're on crates.io —
# `day new app` writes this form for you)
[dependencies]
day = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" }
day-piece-rating = { path = "../day-piece-rating" }   # a plain dependency, nothing else to wire
```

Then use it like a built-in piece, bound to your own `Signal`:

```rust
use day::prelude::*;
use day_piece_rating::rating;

fn review_form() -> impl Piece {
    let stars = Signal::new(3usize);
    column((
        label("How was it?").font(Font::Title),
        rating(stars).max(5).star_size(32.0),
        // reacts live: reads `stars`, re-renders only this label when a star is tapped
        label(move || format!("{} / 5", stars.get())),
    ))
    .spacing(12.0)
    .padding(20.0)
}
```

Run `day launch -p macos-appkit`, then `-p android-mdc`, then `-p linux-gtk`. The same rating
renders natively on each, drawn by that platform's 2D API from the one `canvas` closure.

## 6. Going further

The same approach covers most of a design system:

- **A card** is a `Modifier`, a reusable transform you apply with `.modifier(m)`:

  ```rust
  pub struct Card { pub tint: Color }
  impl Modifier for Card {
      fn apply(self, content: AnyPiece) -> AnyPiece {
          content.padding(16.0).background(self.tint).corner_radius(12.0)
      }
  }
  // usage: my_content.modifier(Card { tint: Color::hex(0xF2F2F7) })
  ```

  For a one-off you do not even need the type; a plain closure is a `Modifier` via the blanket impl:
  `my_content.modifier(|c: AnyPiece| c.padding(16.0).corner_radius(12.0))`. The shipped
  `day-piece-rating` crate includes a ready-made `Card` of exactly this shape.

- **A badge** is `.overlay_aligned(Alignment::TopTrailing, dot)`, an annotation layered on top of an
  avatar or icon without disturbing its layout size. `day-piece-rating` ships one as
  `badge(count, over)`.

- **A chip** is a labeled `.background(...).corner_radius(...)` capsule; a **pill button** is a
  `ButtonStyle` (`FilledButtonStyle` is the shipped example) applied with `Button::style`.

- **Themed subtrees** flow through `with_environment(value, || …)` and are read back with
  `environment::<T>()`, so a value set once reaches every descendant without being passed through
  each builder.
