A **tweak** configures the native widget behind a built-in [piece](/docs/glossary#piece).
For example, you can apply AppKit’s toolbar bezel to a button or enable tick marks on a XAML
slider. Day continues to manage the widget’s layout and lifecycle. A **Tweaked Piece** uses
the same widget and handle with additional configuration.

The showcase's Tweaks page (in the [gallery](/gallery)) demonstrates everything on this page.

## Applying a tweak

The portable entry point is a modifier that runs once at mount, after the native widget exists:

```rust
button("Save").tweak(|node| {
    // `node` is the realized node; per-toolkit accessors turn it into a native handle.
})
```

Each toolkit crate adds a typed extension trait over that, and that trait is the normal entry
point. The closure gets the native widget **and its concrete class name**, so a tweak knows
exactly what it is configuring:

```rust
use day_appkit::AppKitExt;   // exists only in the appkit build

button("Save").appkit(|view, class, _mtm| {   // class == "NSButton"
    if let Some(btn) = view.downcast_ref::<objc2_app_kit::NSButton>() {
        unsafe { btn.setBezelStyle(objc2_app_kit::NSBezelStyle::Toolbar) };
    }
})
```

`.gtk(|widget, class| …)`, `.uikit(|view, class, mtm| …)`, and `.android(|view, class, jni_env| …)`
follow the same shape with each platform's types. Qt, XAML, and ArkUI sit behind C shims, so
their accessors hand out the raw native pointer (plus the class) instead, with a short
bring-your-own-C++ recipe (each tier is spelled out in the
[tweaks reference](/docs/internal/tweaks)).

The class name keeps a tweak from breaking silently. On the typed tiers it's the *live* widget's
runtime class, so if a piece ever has more than one native backing (a plain `label` as `UILabel`,
a link-bearing one as `UITextView`), the tweak can `match` on the class instead of guessing a
downcast. On the raw tiers, where Rust can't introspect an opaque pointer, it's the metadata your
C++ needs: pass it across the shim and guard the cast so the pointer is never reinterpreted as
the wrong control.

Day re-applies the properties it *manages* (a button's title, a slider's value) on its next update,
so tweak the properties Day doesn't touch (bezels, tick marks, selectability) and they're stable.
And if a native call changes the widget's intrinsic size, tell layout with
`day::invalidate_size(node)`, because Day can't see mutations it didn't make.

## Reaching a widget later

A mount-time hook covers configuration; for imperative access afterward (from an event handler,
say), capture a `NativeRef`:

```rust
let save_ref = NativeRef::new();

column((
    button("Save").native_ref(&save_ref),
    button("Flash the save button").action(move || {
        save_ref.with(|node| { /* per-toolkit accessor on `node` */ });
    }),
))
```

The ref clears automatically when the piece unmounts, so a late timer or async completion is a
safe `None`, never a dangling widget. Reads are [reactive](/docs/glossary#reactive), too: a label whose closure calls
`save_ref.node()` re-renders when the referenced piece mounts or disappears.

## Packaged tweaks

To reuse a tweak across apps, package it: a `day-tweak-*` crate wraps the per-toolkit calls in one
modifier and no-ops on [toolkits](/docs/glossary#toolkit) it doesn't cover, so the *app* using it
stays free of `#[cfg]`. Three examples in the repository show different platform configurations:

```rust
use day_tweak_button_bezel::{Bezel, ButtonBezelTweak};
use day_tweak_tooltip::TooltipTweak;
use day_tweak_slider_tickmarks::{SliderTickmarksTweak, Tickmarks};

button("Save").bezel(Bezel::Toolbar);          // AppKit only; stock elsewhere
button("Save").tooltip("Save your changes (⌘S)");  // AppKit, GTK, Android; no-op elsewhere
slider(v).tickmarks(Tickmarks::count(11).snap(true));  // six toolkits, incl. its own C++
```

The tick-marks crate demonstrates configuring a native feature on
six toolkits through objc2, gtk4-rs, JNI, and compiled Qt C++,
WinRT C++, and ArkUI NDK code. It documents each platform's behavior (Material sliders always
snap when stepped; UIKit has no native tick API, so there it's a no-op). Publish the
crate as a Cargo package. Consumers add it as a dependency, and `day build` enables the corresponding toolkit features.

The [tweaks reference](/docs/internal/tweaks) has the full per-toolkit matrix, the native-code
recipes, and the mechanics underneath. To add a new widget, write a
[native piece](/docs/extending).
