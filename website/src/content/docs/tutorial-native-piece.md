A native piece wraps a platform control behind a shared Rust API. Each supported toolkit needs
an implementation that creates, updates, and measures the control.

This tutorial builds a search field bound to a `Signal<String>`. The complete implementation is
in [`day-piece-searchfield`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-searchfield).
The resulting crate can be added to an app without changing Day’s core.

## 1. When you need a native piece

The deciding question is whether you are wrapping a native control or arranging Pieces.

| You are… | Tier | What you write |
|---|---|---|
| Arranging existing Pieces into a reusable unit | **Composite piece** | A `Piece` whose `build` returns `column((...))`, in plain Rust with no backend. |
| Wrapping one native widget per platform | **Native piece** (this tutorial) | A front-end plus a backend per toolkit. |
| Adding a headless capability (battery, clipboard) | **Part** | A `day-part-*` crate selected by `#[cfg(target_os)]`; it registers no renderer. |

A native piece is warranted when the thing you want does not exist as a composition: it has native
text input, native scrolling physics, a system popover, camera/map/media surfaces, or platform
accessibility semantics you cannot compose. The search field qualifies: `NSSearchField`,
`UISearchTextField`, `GtkSearchEntry`, and the rest each bring a magnifier, a clear button, and IME
behavior that a hand-rolled `text_field` would not.

You will implement `make`/`update`/`measure` once per toolkit, and each one speaks that
toolkit's native API. The rest of this tutorial is about making that as mechanical as
possible, and [step 6](#6-generating-the-backend-bodies) shows how to delegate most of the typing.

## 2. The architecture

Start with the scaffolder. `day new piece --toolkits <list>` generates every file described below:
the front-end `src/lib.rs` (builder + `KIND` + `Props`/`Patch` + a `day_pieces::glue_modules!(…)`
backend index), one `src/lib-<backend>.rs` renderer per toolkit, and the `[features]` table. Where
a backend needs native glue, it also emits the C++ shim + `build.rs` (Qt/XAML), the Java shim +
`[package.metadata.day.android]` (Android/`mdc`), and the `[package.metadata.day.ios]` block with
a commented `platform = "16.0"` floor key (iOS/`uikit`). Choosing `appkit` adds a commented
`[package.metadata.day.macos]` block for Swift contributions on the macOS leg:

```bash
day new piece day-piece-searchfield --toolkits appkit,gtk,qt,uikit,mdc,xaml
```

Pick any subset of `appkit,gtk,qt,uikit,mdc,xaml`; passing `--toolkits` at all makes it a native
piece rather than a composite one. The crate builds against a remote Day release (add `--local
<path>` for a local Day checkout). Everything from here down describes what the scaffolder produces
and how the halves fit together.

One crate carries both halves of the piece:

- **The front-end**: cross-platform Rust. A builder function, a config struct, and an
  `impl Piece` whose `build` emits a *native leaf* of a well-known `KIND` string and wires up
  reactivity. This is the only code an app author ever calls.
- **A backend per toolkit**: one file each (`lib-appkit.rs`, `lib-gtk.rs`, `lib-qt.rs`,
  `lib-uikit.rs`, `lib-android.rs`, `lib-xaml.rs`), compiled only for its feature+target, that
  turns the `KIND` leaf into a native widget.

The two halves never call each other directly. They communicate through a typed protocol:

- **`KIND`**: a stable string (`"day.piece.searchfield"`) naming this piece to every backend.
- **`Props`**: the full "realize" payload, handed to a backend's `make` when the widget is first
  created (initial text, placeholder, …).
- **`Patch`**: a *sparse* enum of imperative changes, handed to `update` when a bound value later
  changes (here just `SetText(String)`).

Backends register themselves into each toolkit's `RENDERERS` slice at link time, via `linkme`.
When a backend's `AppKit::new()` starts up it walks `RENDERERS` and builds a registry:

```rust
// toolkits/day-appkit/src/lib.rs
#[distributed_slice]
pub static RENDERERS: [fn() -> Renderer<AppKit>];

let mut registry = Registry::default();
for f in RENDERERS { registry.register(f()); }   // your piece is now known to AppKit
```

Because registration is link-time, linking your crate into the AppKit build inserts its renderer
into the registry.

The `renderer!` macro keeps the backend bodies short. `Props` and `Patch` cross
the backend boundary type-erased as `&dyn Any`; the macro inserts the downcast for you, so your
`make`/`update` see fully typed `&SearchProps` / `&SearchPatch`:

```rust
// crates/day-pieces/src/render.rs (what the macro expands to, abridged)
make: |backend, props, id| {
    let p = props.downcast_ref::<SearchProps>()
        .expect("day renderer: props are not SearchProps");
    make_fn(backend, p, id)            // ← your typed fn
},
update: |backend, handle, patch| {
    if let Some(p) = patch.downcast_ref::<SearchPatch>() {
        update_fn(backend, handle, p)  // ← your typed fn
    }
},
```

You write `fn make(backend: &mut AppKit, p: &SearchProps, id: NodeId)` and one `renderer!` line; the
macro owns the downcast.

## 3. The front-end

The front-end is the only part every backend shares, and the only part an app author touches. It
consists of the config struct and builder, the `Props`/`Patch` types, and the `impl Piece`.

### The `KIND`, `Props`, and `Patch`

```rust
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/src/lib.rs
pub const KIND: &str = "day.piece.searchfield";

/// Full props (realize). `text` seeds the control; `placeholder` is the empty-state prompt.
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, PartialEq)]
pub struct SearchProps {
    pub text: String,
    pub placeholder: String,
}

/// The single imperative update: replace the control's text (programmatic sync from the signal).
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum SearchPatch {
    SetText(String),
}
```

`Props` is everything a backend needs to build the widget from scratch. `Patch` is the *sparse* set
of changes that can happen afterward. Keep it minimal: each variant is one thing a backend must know
how to apply. A search field only ever needs its text re-synced, so `Patch` has exactly one variant.

### The builder and config struct

```rust
pub struct SearchField {
    query: Signal<String>,
    placeholder: Option<TextSource>,
}

/// `search_field(query)`: a native search input whose text mirrors `query` in both directions.
pub fn search_field(query: Signal<String>) -> SearchField {
    SearchField { query, placeholder: None }
}

impl SearchField {
    /// The empty-state prompt (evaluated once; the placeholder is not reactive after build).
    pub fn placeholder<M>(mut self, t: impl IntoText<M>) -> Self {
        self.placeholder = Some(t.into_text());
        self
    }
}
```

This is the ordinary Day builder idiom: a free function returns a config struct, chained `.method()`
calls fill it in. Because `SearchField` will `impl Piece`, it also gets `.id()`, `.a11y()`, and
`.frame()` from the blanket `Decorate` impl.

### `impl Piece`: emit the leaf, bind reactivity, handle events

In `build`, the front-end emits the native leaf, binds the signal *into* the control, and routes
native events *out of* it.

```rust
impl Piece for SearchField {
    fn build(self, cx: &mut BuildCx) -> RNode {
        let SearchField { query, placeholder } = self;
        let initial = query.get_untracked();
        let ph = placeholder.map(|p| p.initial()).unwrap_or_default();

        // (1) Emit a native leaf of KIND. `cx.leaf` hands `&SearchProps` to the backend's `make`.
        let node = cx.leaf(
            KIND,
            &SearchProps { text: initial.clone(), placeholder: ph },
            // A search field fills the available width and keeps its natural (single-line) height.
            Flex { grow_w: true, ..Default::default() },
        );

        // (2) Bind the signal into the control: when `query` changes, patch the widget's text.
        //     `bind_seeded` runs the setter once now, then on every change to a read signal.
        let guard: Rc<RefCell<Option<String>>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(None));
        let g = guard.clone();
        bind_seeded(
            initial,
            move || query.get(),
            move |t: &String| {
                // Echo guard (see below): skip the value that just came from the native widget.
                let from_native = g.borrow_mut().take().as_deref() == Some(t.as_str());
                if !from_native {
                    with_tree(|tr| tr.patch(node, Box::new(SearchPatch::SetText(t.clone())), false));
                }
            },
        );

        // (3) Route native edits out of the control back into the signal.
        cx.on(node, move |ev| {
            if let Event::TextChanged(t) = ev {
                *guard.borrow_mut() = Some(t.clone());   // remember: this value came from native
                query.set(t.clone());
            }
        });
        node
    }
}
```

A closer look at each step:

- **`cx.leaf(KIND, &props, flex)`** creates a native-leaf node of `KIND`. `Flex { grow_w: true, .. }`
  makes it a width-growing leaf (it fills its row, keeps its natural single-line height), the same
  shape as the built-in `text_field`.
- **`bind_seeded(seed, read, apply)`** is the reactive setter. It applies `apply` once with the seed,
  then re-runs it whenever the read closure's signal changes, emitting a sparse `Patch`. Only this
  binding re-runs; there is no view re-execution.
- **The echo guard** is the one subtlety of any *two-way* (controlled) input. The user types → the
  native widget fires `Event::TextChanged` → `cx.on` writes the signal → `bind_seeded` sees the signal
  change and would immediately patch the control with the value it *just produced*, which some
  toolkits re-emit as another change → a feedback loop. The `guard` cell remembers the last value that
  arrived *from* native so `bind_seeded` skips patching that one value straight back. (One-way pieces
  do not need this.)

That completes the front-end; the remaining code is native, one backend per toolkit.

## 4. The backends, one per toolkit

Each backend lives in a separate file, compiled only for its feature+target, so the whole native
surface for a toolkit sits in one place. One macro line at the bottom of `lib.rs` declares them
all:

```rust
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/src/lib.rs
day_pieces::glue_modules!(appkit, gtk, qt, uikit, mdc, xaml);
```

Each name expands to the conventional module gate; for `appkit`, for example:

```rust
#[cfg(all(feature = "appkit", target_os = "macos"))]
#[path = "lib-appkit.rs"]
mod appkit_impl;
```

List only the toolkits you implement; a piece with a non-standard gate (webview's Linux-only GTK,
say) writes that one block by hand beside the macro.

Every backend implements the same three functions and ends with one `renderer!` line:

- **`make(backend, &Props, NodeId) -> Handle`**: build the native widget, wire its change callback to
  `day_<backend>::emit(id, Event::TextChanged(..))` (the `NodeId` handed to `make`), return the
  toolkit's handle type.
- **`update(backend, &Handle, &Patch)`**: apply a sparse patch (here, set the text) *guarded on
  equality* so a programmatic sync is a no-op when unchanged.
- **`measure(backend, &Handle, Proposal) -> Size`**: report the widget's size given a proposal. All
  six of our backends grow to the proposed width and keep their natural height.

### AppKit: `NSSearchField` via objc2 (the fully worked backend)

The Apple backends drive Objective-C objects from Rust through the `objc2` crates. An
`NSSearchField` *is* an `NSTextField`, so a per-node delegate implementing `controlTextDidChange:`
delivers each keystroke. Programmatic `setStringValue:` does not fire that delegate, so this backend
needs no echo guard of its own; `update` writes when the value differs.

```rust
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/src/lib-appkit.rs (abridged)
use super::*;
use day_appkit::AppKit;
use day_spec::{NodeId, Proposal, Size};
use objc2_app_kit::{NSSearchField, NSTextField, NSView, NSTextFieldDelegate, NSControlTextEditingDelegate};

// A DefinedClass delegate carrying the NodeId; controlTextDidChange: → Event::TextChanged.
// (define_class! + an ivar holding `node`, omitted for length; see the file.)

fn make(backend: &mut AppKit, p: &SearchProps, id: NodeId) -> Retained<NSView> {
    let mtm = backend.mtm();
    let field = NSSearchField::new(mtm);
    if !p.placeholder.is_empty() {
        field.setPlaceholderString(Some(&NSString::from_str(&p.placeholder)));
    }
    field.setStringValue(&NSString::from_str(&p.text));
    let target = SearchTarget::new(mtm, id);     // per-node delegate, kept alive in a TLS map
    let tf: &NSTextField = field.as_ref();
    unsafe { tf.setDelegate(Some(ProtocolObject::from_ref(&*target))) };
    Retained::from(<NSSearchField as AsRef<NSView>>::as_ref(&field))
}

fn update(_backend: &mut AppKit, h: &Retained<NSView>, patch: &SearchPatch) {
    let SearchPatch::SetText(t) = patch;
    if let Some(field) = h.downcast_ref::<NSSearchField>() {
        if field.stringValue().to_string() != *t {         // equality-guarded
            field.setStringValue(&NSString::from_str(t));
        }
    }
}

fn measure(_backend: &mut AppKit, h: &Retained<NSView>, p: Proposal) -> Size {
    let fit = h.fittingSize();
    Size::new(p.width.unwrap_or(fit.width).max(120.0), fit.height.ceil().max(22.0))
}

// The one line that registers this backend link-time. The macro inserts the downcast.
day_pieces::renderer!(day_appkit::RENDERERS, AppKit,
    kind: KIND, props: SearchProps, patch: SearchPatch,
    make: make, update: update, measure: measure);
```

The other backends are the *same three functions* against a different native API. Here is the shape
of each.

### UIKit: `UISearchTextField` via objc2

A separate file from AppKit (different `objc2-ui-kit` types), but the same pattern: build a
`UISearchTextField`, then attach a per-node target on `UIControlEvents::EditingChanged` that emits
`Event::TextChanged`. Since programmatic `setText:` does not fire `EditingChanged`, there is no echo
guard. `measure` uses `sizeThatFits:`. The handle type is `Retained<UIView>`, and the `renderer!`
targets `day_uikit::RENDERERS, Uikit`.

### GTK: `GtkSearchEntry` via gtk4-rs

This backend is pure Rust through `gtk4`. `GtkSearchEntry::new()` gives the magnifier + clear icon.
Its `search-changed` signal fires on both user input and programmatic `set_text`, so this backend
carries a per-node `suppress: Rc<Cell<bool>>`. `update` raises it around `set_text` so the resulting
signal does not echo back as an `Event::TextChanged`:

```rust
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/src/lib-gtk.rs (the guard)
entry.connect_search_changed(move |e| {
    if sup.get() { return; }                                  // suppressed = programmatic
    day_gtk::emit(id, Event::TextChanged(e.text().to_string()));
});
// …in update:
st.suppress.set(true);  st.entry.set_text(t);  st.suppress.set(false);
```

### Qt: a hand-written C++ shim behind a flat `extern "C"` ABI

Qt has no Rust bindings in Day, so the piece carries its own C++ shim, `src/lib-qt-shim.cpp`, and
`build.rs` compiles it. The shim wraps a `QLineEdit` configured as a search box (clear button + a
leading magnifier action) and exposes a flat C ABI: `day_search_new` takes a callback pointer and
a `u64` node id; `textChanged` calls back with a UTF-8 string; and programmatic `setText` is
wrapped in `blockSignals` so it never echoes:

```cpp
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/src/lib-qt-shim.cpp (abridged)
class DaySearch : public QLineEdit {
public:
    void setTextGuarded(const QString &t) {
        if (text() != t) { blockSignals(true); setText(t); blockSignals(false); }
    }
};
extern "C" void *day_search_new(const char *placeholder, const char *initial, uint64_t id,
                                void (*cb)(uint64_t, const char *)) {
    auto *w = new DaySearch();
    w->setPlaceholderText(QString::fromUtf8(placeholder));
    w->setClearButtonEnabled(true);
    w->addAction(QIcon::fromTheme(QStringLiteral("edit-find")), QLineEdit::LeadingPosition);
    if (initial && *initial) w->setText(QString::fromUtf8(initial));
    QObject::connect(w, &QLineEdit::textChanged,
                     [id, cb](const QString &t) { cb(id, t.toUtf8().constData()); });
    return w;
}
```

The Rust side (`lib-qt.rs`) declares those `extern "C"` functions, calls them from `make`/`update`,
and reuses `day_qt_size_hint` (already linked by `day-qt-sys`) for `measure`. The shim is compiled by
`build.rs` via `cc` + `pkg-config`, gated on the feature:

```rust
// pieces/day-piece-searchfield/build.rs (Qt branch, abridged)
if std::env::var("CARGO_FEATURE_QT").is_ok() {
    let cflags = Command::new("pkg-config").args(["--cflags", "Qt6Widgets"]).output().unwrap();
    let mut build = cc::Build::new();
    build.cpp(true).std("c++17").file("src/lib-qt-shim.cpp");
    for tok in String::from_utf8_lossy(&cflags.stdout).split_whitespace() { build.flag(tok); }
    build.compile("daysearchqtshim");   // Qt libs themselves are already linked by day-qt-sys
}
```

### Android: a Java factory staged through Gradle, called over JNI

The Android widget is created by a Java factory the piece ships under
`platform/android/java/dev/daybrite/day/piece/searchfield/DaySearch.java`. It uses only `day-android`'s public
Java surface: `DayBridge.ctx` (the `Context`) and `DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, kind, num, str)` (the
event trampoline; `kind 1` = TextChanged):

```java
// platform/android/java/…/DaySearch.java (abridged)
public static View makeSearch(final long id, String placeholder, String initial) {
    EditText e = new EditText(DayBridge.ctx);
    e.setSingleLine(true);
    e.setImeOptions(EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEARCH);
    e.setHint(placeholder);
    if (initial != null && !initial.isEmpty()) { e.setText(initial); e.setSelection(initial.length()); }
    e.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {
        public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) { DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, 1, 0, s.toString()); }
        public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s,int a,int b,int c){}
        public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s,int a,int b,int c){}
    });
    return e;
}
```

`lib-android.rs` calls that class through the re-exported `jni` (`with_env` + `call_static_method`),
returning a global ref as the handle. The factory reaches the app's Gradle build automatically:
the piece declares its Java dir in `Cargo.toml`, and `day build` folds it in with no edit to
`day-android` and no per-piece Gradle edit:

```toml
# pieces/day-piece-searchfield/Cargo.toml
[package.metadata.day.android]
java = ["platform/android/java"]        # → Gradle java.srcDirs
gradle-dependencies = []       # EditText is a framework widget; nothing to pull
gradle-repositories = []
# permissions = ["android.permission.INTERNET"]   # add if your control needs one (e.g. a web view)
```

### XAML: a C++/WinRT shim, boxed through `day-xaml-sys`

Symmetric to Qt: the piece carries `src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp`, a C++/WinRT shim wrapping an
`AutoSuggestBox` (the XAML search control). Because XAML handles are a private boxed type owned by
`day-xaml-sys`, the shim boxes its XAML element through that crate's exported
`day_xaml_box`/`day_xaml_unbox` functions, and reuses `day_xaml_measure`. `build.rs` compiles it
with `cc` (MSVC) + the Windows SDK cppwinrt projection. It is Windows-only and built in CI; you
will likely not verify it locally.

### Generalizing the pattern

For any native piece, each backend is the same three functions:

1. **`make`**: construct the native widget from `Props`; wire its change callback to
   `day_<backend>::emit(id, event)` with the `NodeId` `make` received; return the toolkit handle.
2. **`update`**: apply a sparse `Patch`, equality-guarded, suppressing the change-callback if the
   toolkit re-emits programmatic edits.
3. **`measure`**: answer a `Proposal` with a `Size` (grow, natural, or fixed).

Toolkits that are hard to drive from Rust (Qt, XAML, non-`@objc` iOS classes, anything on the Android
`Context`) get a *native asset*: a C++ shim compiled in `build.rs`, an Android Java factory staged via
`[package.metadata.day.android]`, or an iOS Swift shim + SwiftPM package via
`[package.metadata.day.ios]`. The last is how a piece links a framework it drives. The media piece,
which hand-rolls `AVPlayerViewController`, declares:

```toml
# pieces/day-piece-media/Cargo.toml
[package.metadata.day.ios]
frameworks = ["AVKit", "AVFoundation", "CoreMedia"]   # linked via the generated DayPieces SwiftPM pkg
```

The same table takes a `platform = "16.0"` key to raise the minimum-OS floor (the max across
contributing crates wins), and `swift-packages` entries may be **local**
(`{ path = "swiftui", products = ["MyViews"] }`, relative to the crate): a local package's public
SwiftUI views are scanned and exported as typed `crate::swiftui::MyView(…)` bindings. A parallel
`[package.metadata.day.macos]` table of the same shape covers the macos-appkit leg: `day build`
hands the contributions to the `platform/macos/` Xcode host project. See the
[SwiftUI embedding reference](/docs/internal/swiftui).

## 5. Register and wire the features

Two pieces of wiring connect the halves.

### The per-backend `renderer!` line

Each backend file ends with one macro call registering it into that
toolkit's slice:

```rust
day_pieces::renderer!(day_gtk::RENDERERS,   Gtk,   kind: KIND, props: SearchProps, patch: SearchPatch, make: make, update: update, measure: measure);
day_pieces::renderer!(day_qt::RENDERERS,    Qt,    kind: KIND, props: SearchProps, patch: SearchPatch, make: make, update: update, measure: measure);
day_pieces::renderer!(day_uikit::RENDERERS, Uikit, kind: KIND, props: SearchProps, patch: SearchPatch, make: make, update: update, measure: measure);
// …and day_android::RENDERERS / day_xaml::RENDERERS likewise.
```

(For a piece configured once with no later updates, drop `patch:`/`update:`; the macro has a
patchless form. Add `measure: day_pieces::fill_measure` for a growing leaf that fills its proposal.)

### The crate's `[features]`

One feature per backend, each pulling in that toolkit crate (and any
objc2/gtk4 crates it needs). A no-op `mock` feature exists so apps can enable the piece uniformly on a
toolkit with no real backend:

```toml
# pieces/day-piece-searchfield/Cargo.toml
[features]
appkit = ["dep:day-appkit", "dep:objc2", "dep:objc2-app-kit", "dep:objc2-foundation"]
gtk    = ["dep:day-gtk", "dep:gtk4"]
qt     = ["dep:day-qt"]              # + build.rs compiles src/lib-qt-shim.cpp
uikit  = ["dep:day-uikit", "dep:objc2", "dep:objc2-ui-kit", "dep:objc2-foundation", "dep:objc2-core-foundation"]
mdc = ["dep:day-android"]         # + [package.metadata.day.android] carries the DaySearch Java
xaml  = ["dep:day-xaml", "dep:day-xaml-sys"]   # + build.rs compiles src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp
mock   = []                          # no renderer; falls back to Day's placeholder leaf
```

### The `backends` marker

A piece declares the backends it carries a renderer feature
for, and the app depends on it without re-listing them:

```toml
# pieces/day-piece-searchfield/Cargo.toml
[package.metadata.day.piece]
backends = ["appkit", "gtk", "qt", "uikit", "mdc", "xaml", "mock"]
```

…and `day build` reads that from `cargo metadata`, walks the app's dependency closure, and derives
`day-piece-searchfield/<backend>` for whichever toolkit it is building, unioning it into the
`--features` automatically ([`crates/day-cli/src/pieces.rs::feature_union`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/blob/main/crates/day-cli/src/pieces.rs)).

As a result, an app adds the piece with a single plain dependency and wires only Day's own
backend; the CLI derives the piece's features:

```toml
# Day-Showcase/Cargo.toml
[features]
appkit = ["day/appkit"]     # the app wires the core backend; the CLI derives the piece's
gtk    = ["day/gtk"]        # day-piece-searchfield/<backend> from its [package.metadata.day.piece]
# …

[dependencies]
day-piece-searchfield = { workspace = true }   # that's it
```

Then use it like a built-in:

```rust
use day_piece_searchfield::search_field;

let query = Signal::new(String::new());
search_field(query).placeholder("Search fruit…").id("fruit-search")
```

If a backend is not registered (say you enabled the piece on a toolkit you have not written yet),
Day does not fail silently. The backend logs a once-per-kind warning and renders a visible
`⟨kind⟩` placeholder in its place (`warn_missing_renderer` in each toolkit crate), in debug and
release builds alike; dayscript's `assert_no_placeholders` step turns the gap into a test
failure.

## 6. Generating the backend bodies

Writing the same widget in Objective-C, C++, Java, and C++/WinRT is the tedious core of a native
piece. It is also a narrow, well-specified translation task: the kind a code generator or an
LLM handles well, once the contract is fixed.

Fix the contract first, then delegate each backend body:

1. **Design the typed protocol in Rust before any native code.** Write `KIND`, the `Props` struct, and
   the sparse `Patch` enum. These are small, and getting them right up front means every backend has
   the same fixed contract to satisfy.
2. **Write the front-end and validate it against the `mock` backend.** The front-end is
   platform-independent; with `day-piece-searchfield/mock` you can exercise `build`, the `bind_seeded`
   binding, the echo guard, and the `cx.on` event routing with no device and no native toolkit at
   all. The typed `renderer!` macro and the mock feature let you get the Rust side completely right
   before you touch Objective-C.
3. **Freeze the flat FFI/JNI signatures.** For the toolkits that need a native asset, decide the C ABI
   (`day_search_new(placeholder, initial, id, cb)` / `day_search_set_text(w, text)`) or the JNI method
   signatures (`makeSearch(long, String, String) -> View` / `setSearchText(View, String)`) up front.
   They are the exact spec you hand the model.
4. **Ask the LLM for each backend body from a one-paragraph description of the native control.** For
   example: *"Write the AppKit backend as an objc2 `make`/`update`/`measure` for a `NSSearchField`
   bound to this `SearchProps`/`SearchPatch`; per-node delegate on `controlTextDidChange:` emitting
   `Event::TextChanged`; no echo guard because programmatic `setStringValue:` doesn't fire the
   delegate."* Then repeat for the Qt C++ shim, the Android Java factory, and the XAML C++/WinRT shim
   against the frozen signatures. Give the model this crate's finished file as the template; it is a
   ready-made few-shot example.
5. **Wire each behind `renderer!` and enable its feature.** Add the module line to `lib.rs`, the
   `renderer!` call at the bottom of the backend file, and the feature to `Cargo.toml`.

Two properties of the design make this workflow safe. First, the typed macro means a body that
compiles has type-checked `Props`/`Patch` handling; the model cannot silently mismatch the protocol.
Second, an unwritten backend degrades to the placeholder rather than breaking the app, so you can
ship AppKit + Android today and add Qt or XAML later without either half of the codebase blocking
the other.

The reference crate to read end-to-end is
[`pieces/day-piece-searchfield`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-searchfield),
the six-backend native realization of one piece;
[`day-piece-media`](https://github.com/daybrite/day/tree/main/pieces/day-piece-media) shows
framework linking. The mechanism is documented in full in
