Day apps fetch through each platform's networking stack: `NSURLSession` on macOS and iOS, OkHttp
on Android, WinHTTP on Windows, the browser's `fetch()` on the web, and a bundled ureq + rustls
client on Linux and HarmonyOS. The request inherits what the OS already knows (system proxies and
PAC scripts, VPN routing, Low Data Mode, certificate stores), and TLS on the native targets comes
from the OS. The call site is:

```rust
day::task(async move {
    match day_part_http::fetch_future(Request::get(url)).await {
        Ok(resp) => body.set(resp.text().into_owned()),
        Err(e) => body.set(format!("error: {e}")),
    }
});
```

**Works on:** macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and web via the platform stack; Linux and
HarmonyOS via the Rust fallback (correct HTTPS, but proxy awareness limited to the
`http_proxy` environment variables); on an unknown target every call returns `Unsupported`.
On web the blocking entry points return `Unsupported`; the async forms work in full.
`day_part_http::tier()` reports the compiled target's tier.

## 1. Fetch into UI state

Add the crate, then hold the request's outcome in signals and let the UI bind them:

```toml
[dependencies]
day-part-http = { git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git" }
```

The `match` goes inside the task: `day::task` takes a future with `Output = ()`, so an async
block that returns a `Result` doesn't compile there; handle both arms and write signals.
Under `day::task` the future resumes on the UI thread, so those writes are plain `set` calls:

```rust
use day::prelude::*;
use day_part_http::{Request, fetch_future};

fn forecast_row() -> impl Piece {
    let readout = Signal::new(String::new());
    let loading = Signal::new(false);
    column((
        button("Fetch").action(move || {
            loading.set(true);
            day::task(async move {
                match fetch_future(Request::get("https://api.example.com/data.json")).await {
                    Ok(resp) if (200..300).contains(&resp.status) => {
                        readout.set(resp.text().into_owned());
                    }
                    Ok(resp) => readout.set(format!("HTTP {}", resp.status)),
                    Err(e) => readout.set(format!("error: {e}")),
                }
                loading.set(false);
            });
        }),
        label(move || if loading.get() { "loading…".to_string() } else { readout.get() }),
    ))
    .spacing(8.0)
}
```

The contract differs from ureq-style clients on error statuses and on timeouts.

- 4xx/5xx are `Ok`. An HTTP error status is a response (`resp.status == 404`), not an `HttpError`,
  which is why the sample checks the status range. Errors are transport-level only: `BadUrl`,
  `Timeout`, `Dns`, `Connect`, `Tls`, `Io`, `Cancelled`, `Unsupported`.
- `timeout` bounds progress, not the transfer. It covers connecting, awaiting the response head, and
  idle gaps; a long download that keeps moving is never cut off. Default 30 s.

`Response` is `{ status, headers, body }` plus `text()` (lossy UTF-8) and a case-insensitive
`header(name)` lookup. There is no built-in JSON layer; parse `resp.body` with `serde_json`,
added as an app dependency:

```rust
#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Forecast { temperature: f64 }

let data: Result<Forecast, _> = serde_json::from_slice(&resp.body);
```

## 2. Cancel an in-flight request

Tasks are not owned by the scope that spawned them: leaving the page does not stop a running fetch.
To cancel, keep the `TaskHandle` that `day::task` returns and call `.abort()`. Aborting drops the
task's future, and dropping the `FetchFuture` cancels the platform request:
`NSURLSessionTask.cancel` on Apple, OkHttp `Call.cancel` on Android, the fetch's `AbortController`
on web. Windows and the Rust fallback can't cancel mid-flight; they run the request out on a worker
thread and discard the result. Re-tapping below supersedes the previous request:

```rust
let inflight: Rc<Cell<Option<day::TaskHandle>>> = Rc::new(Cell::new(None));
button("Check").action(move || {
    if let Some(prev) = inflight.take() {
        prev.abort();                     // drops the FetchFuture → platform cancel
    }
    let slot = inflight.clone();
    let handle = day::task(async move {
        match fetch_future(Request::get(url.get_untracked())).await {
            Ok(resp) => readout.set(format!("HTTP {} · {} bytes", resp.status, resp.body.len())),
            Err(e) => readout.set(format!("error: {e}")),
        }
        slot.set(None);
    });
    inflight.set(Some(handle));
});
```

Aborting a finished task is a no-op, and a write to a signal whose scope has since been
disposed is a silent no-op, so a late completion can't crash a page the user already left.

## 3. Load on mount with Resource

For "fetch when this page appears, refetch when an input changes", `day::reactive::Resource`
is the scope-tied form: a tracked `source` feeds an async `fetcher`, and the result is stored in a
`Signal<Load<T>>`. Unlike `day::task`, the fetcher returns a `Result`, and the error becomes
`Load::Failed`:

```rust
use day::reactive::{Load, Resource};

let forecast: Resource<String> = Resource::new(
    move || city.get(),                       // tracked — a city change refetches
    |city| async move {
        let url = format!("https://api.example.com/wx?city={city}");
        let resp = day_part_http::fetch_future(Request::get(url)).await?;
        Ok::<_, day_part_http::HttpError>(resp.text().into_owned())
    },
);
label(move || forecast.with(|l| match l {
    Load::Loading => "…".to_string(),
    Load::Ready(s) => s.clone(),
    Load::Failed(e) => format!("error: {e}"),
}))
```

The latest source value wins. A source change aborts the in-flight fetch (dropping its
`FetchFuture`, the same cancel path as above) and a stale completion writes nothing. Scope
disposal aborts it too, with no handle bookkeeping, and `forecast.refetch()` forces a fresh
fetch. Watch the import: the prelude's `Resource` is the bundled-asset handle; the async one is
`day::reactive::Resource`.

## 4. Other methods, headers, and bodies

`Request` builds every common shape: `get`/`delete`/`head(url)`, and `post`/`put`/`patch(url,
body)` taking the body bytes up front. `.header(name, value)` appends (duplicates allowed,
sent in order), and `.allow_expensive(bool)` / `.allow_constrained(bool)` gate cellular and
Low Data Mode use (native on Apple, advisory elsewhere):

```rust
let req = Request::post("https://api.example.com/notes", note_json_bytes)
    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(15));
```

For large downloads, `fetch_to_file(&req, &dest)` streams the body straight to disk, never
holding it in memory; `fetch_streamed` adds per-chunk control (progress, hashing, mid-body
cancel). To cache a response across launches, write `resp.body` with `day-part-fs`; see
[Store data on device](/docs/guide-storage).

## Pitfalls

- Don't block the UI thread. `fetch`, `fetch_to_file`, and `fetch_streamed` block their
  calling thread; run them on a worker thread, or use the futures under `day::task`. On web
  the blocking calls return `Unsupported`; the single browser thread cannot wait.
- `fetch_async` completes on a background thread. Never touch signals directly in its
  callback; capture a `Setter` (`signal.setter()`), which hops to the UI thread itself. Under
  `day::task`, `fetch_future` resumes on the UI thread and needs none of this.
- Cleartext `http://` is platform policy. Apple's ATS refuses non-HTTPS URLs without a
  scoped Info.plist exception (loopback is exempt); Android blocks cleartext app-wide since
  targetSdk 28, loopback included; scope an exception in `network_security_config.xml`. The
  Rust fallback enforces no such policy, another reason `tier()` exists.
- The browser adds CORS. On web, cross-origin requests need the server's opt-in, and
  browser-controlled request headers (`Host`, `Cookie`, `Origin`) are ignored per the fetch
  spec. Network-level failures surface as `HttpError::Io`, since browsers hide DNS/TLS detail.
