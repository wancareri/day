// The glossary: one entry per term, read by two consumers. The Glossary page
// (src/content/docs/glossary.mdx) lists every entry; the rehype plugin
// (plugins/glossary-links.mjs) attaches an entry's definition to any docs link into
// `/docs/glossary#<id>`, which DocsLayout shows as a popover.
//
// A definition is one to three plain sentences, in the sense the docs give the word (where the
// word has an everyday meaning too, the entry says which applies). Backticks mark code
// (`Signal<T>`) and are the only markup: the popover builds its text as DOM nodes, never as HTML.
// `see` names the page where the concept is introduced, which the popover offers as "Defined in".
