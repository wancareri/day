# day-fonts

A small library for reading a font file's names — the family name and PostScript name —
straight from `.ttf` or `.otf` bytes.

Day uses it to make bundled fonts work by family name on every platform: the build tool
reads each font's real family name and stores the file under a predictable identifier, and
the runtime derives the same identifier back. This crate is that shared vocabulary, in one
place, used by both sides.

It has no dependencies and no text-shaping machinery, so it's also handy in any program
that just needs to know what a font file calls itself.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
