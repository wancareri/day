//! day doctor — development-environment diagnosis, grouped by toolkit (DESIGN.md §16.5).
//!
//! Default (`day doctor`): checks the core toolchain plus every toolkit buildable on this host. A
//! missing OPTIONAL toolkit dependency is a WARNING (yellow) and doctor still exits 0 — you only need
//! the toolkits you actually build. Core (rust) failures are always errors.
//!
//! Focused (`day doctor --toolkit qt --toolkit android`): the named toolkits' checks become hard
//! ERRORS (a missing piece exits non-zero), and detailed per-OS setup instructions are printed for
//! each requested toolkit. This is what CI uses so a build job fails loudly on a misconfigured
//! environment instead of deep inside cargo/gradle/hvigor.
