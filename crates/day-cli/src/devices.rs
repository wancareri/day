//! `day devices` — what a mobile target can be launched onto right now (docs/cli.md).
//!
//! The launch paths have always been able to enumerate simulators, phones and emulators, but only
//! ever privately: `--ios-simulator`, `--android-device` and `--ohos-device` name a device the user
//! already knew about, and the error for getting it wrong was the only listing on offer. This
//! command turns that into an answer — for a person at a terminal, and for the editors that drive
//! the CLI (day-vscode fills its device picker from `--json`).
//!
//! The JSON envelope follows `day metadata`'s contract: versioned and GROW-ONLY, so add keys freely
//! and never repurpose an existing one. Two shapes in it carry weight:
//!
//!   * each device names the **flag** that selects it. iOS alone needs two different flags
//!     depending on whether the pick is a simulator or a physical phone, and keeping that mapping
//!     here rather than in every editor means a new device class costs no editor release. The
//!     `bootable` half carries it too, for the same reason and one more: an editor that shows a
//!     row for a device WHILE it boots has to record how that device will be selected before it
//!     exists, and deriving it from the target there would put the mapping back in the editor.
//!   * a target that cannot be enumerated reports `available: false` with a `note` rather than an
//!     empty list, so a caller can say WHY there is nothing to choose. One missing toolchain must
//!     never blank out the other two — the same reason `day metadata` degrades instead of failing.
//!
//! Enumerating Android starts an `adb` server daemon that outlives the command; that is adb's
//! design, not ours, but it is why this is a command a caller runs deliberately rather than
//! something the CLI does on the side.
