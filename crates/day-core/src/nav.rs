//! Route registry (docs/navigation.md): every mounted `nav()` / `nav_stack()` host
//! register a controller here. Registrations form a STACK so hosts can nest — e.g. a `tabs()`
//! inside a `nav()` route — and the stack order IS the nesting order (outermost first).
//!
//! Two addressing modes (docs/navigation.md):
//!   * A single key (`navigate("inbox")`) is RELATIVE: tried innermost-first, falling through
//!     outward — a tab key selects the tab, a key the tabs host doesn't know still resolves
//!     against the enclosing surface.
//!   * A `/`-separated path (`navigate("mail/inbox/msg-42")`) is ABSOLUTE: the first segment
//!     anchors at the outermost surface that recognizes it, every surface INSIDE the anchor is
//!     reset to its root, and the remaining segments are consumed inward — including by
//!     surfaces that only mount as the outer switch takes effect (a pending queue hands each
//!     newly registered surface the next segment).
//!
//! A trailing `?name=value&…` query carries [`route_params`] to the destination builders.
//! [`current_route`] reports the FULL path — every mounted surface's contribution, outermost
//! to innermost — so persisting navigation is `save(current_route())` + `navigate(&saved)`.
