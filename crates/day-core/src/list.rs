//! Recycling-list driver (docs/list.md, §10). The native list host owns scrolling + cell reuse;
//! Day owns row *content*. day-core injects a [`day_spec::ListSource`] into the backend; when the
//! native data-source pulls a cell, `bind_row` builds it once (per physical cell) and thereafter
//! *rebinds* it — one slot-write — as the cell recycles.
//!
//! Re-entrancy (the crux): building a row uses `BuildCx`, and reactive bindings patch native
//! widgets — both acquire `with_tree` per operation. So `bind_row` phases the tree borrow:
//! `with_tree` (adopt cell) → build/rebind + `flush_sync` **outside** any borrow → `with_tree`
//! (lay the row out in its cell). Holding the borrow across the build would deadlock the RefCell.
