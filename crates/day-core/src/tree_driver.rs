//! Recycling-tree driver (docs/tree.md). [`crate::list`]'s shape addressed by TOKEN instead of
//! row index: the native tree host owns scrolling, disclosure and cell reuse; Day owns row
//! *content*. day-core injects a [`day_spec::TreeSource`] into the backend; when the native
//! data-source pulls a cell, `bind_row` builds it once (per physical cell) and thereafter
//! *rebinds* it — one slot-write — as the cell recycles.
//!
//! Re-entrancy follows `list.rs` exactly: `bind_row` phases the tree borrow —
//! `with_tree` (adopt cell) → build/rebind + `flush_sync` **outside** any borrow → `with_tree`
//! (lay the row out in its cell). Holding the borrow across the build would deadlock the RefCell.
