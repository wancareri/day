//! The dayscript **recorder** (DESIGN.md §14.6): the inverse of playback. Where the engine turns a
//! script into synthesized Day events, the recorder turns the events an app actually receives back
//! into a script. It rides one seam — [`day_core::set_event_observer`], the single point EVERY
//! backend funnels its native events through ([`day_core::enqueue_events`]) — so it needs no
//! per-toolkit code, and it emits an ordinary dayscript that replays cross-toolkit through the same
//! executor as any hand-written one.
//!
//! Scope is deliberately narrow: **actions only, and only where the step is portable**. A tap, a
//! text edit, a selection/toggle, a navigation, a back — the id-addressed things a walkthrough is
//! made of. Positional taps, gestures, slider drags, and native OS chrome are dropped (see
//! [`event_to_step`]); the resulting script is a starting point to edit, not a pixel-exact replay.
//!
//! Everything here is main-thread state (the observer only ever runs on the main thread, where
//! day-core dispatches). On wasm there is no in-process playback ([`play`]) — the WebSocket
//! transport drives the page instead (docs/web.md).
