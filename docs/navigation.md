# Navigation (`nav`, `nav_stack`)

Day models navigation the way it models everything else: as a projection of an app-owned
`Signal`. There is no imperative navigation controller in app code; you own the state, and
the native container is reconciled to it. Two primitives cover the field, matching what every
native toolkit provides:

- **`nav`**: a flat one-of-N choice, bound to a `Signal` of the active key. Its
  `.style` picks the native chrome.
- **`nav_stack`**: a push/pop stack, bound to a `Signal<Vec<_>>` **path**.

Both are generic over the key type, any [`Route`](#typed-routes): plain `String`s for
stringly-keyed quick starts, or an app-defined enum for compile-checked navigation whose
variants can carry data. A thin string-route adapter (`navigate`, `nav_back`, `current_route`)
sits underneath so deep links and dayscript address surfaces by key either way, but the
surfaces themselves run on their signals.

## `nav`: one-of-N

```rust
let section = Signal::new("home".to_string());
nav(section)                       // adaptive by default; .style() pins a shape
    .title(tr("app-title"))
    .header(sidebar_header)             // optional piece above the list
    .item("home",     tr("home"),     home_page)
    .item("settings", tr("settings"), settings_page)
```

### Styles

| `NavStyle` | What it draws |
|---|---|
| `Automatic` **(default)** | The platform's own answer at this width — see the ladder below. |
| `Tabs` | A tab bar at every size, however wide the window gets. |
| `Sidebar` | A NavigationSplitView: both panes where there is room, collapsing to a list that pushes the detail where there is not. |

`Automatic` walks one ladder, and only its bottom rung is platform-specific:

| window width | presentation |
|---|---|
| `Expanded` and wider (≥ 840pt) | `Split` — sidebar beside detail |
| `Medium` (600–839pt) | `Rail` — a narrow strip beside the content |
| `Compact` (< 600pt) | `Tabs` where a tab bar is the idiom, `Stack` where it is not |

That last row is `Cap::NavTabsAdaptive`, and it describes the platform rather than its widget
set. Every desktop can draw a tab bar (an app is free to pin `NavStyle::Tabs`), and none of
them grows one when its window is dragged narrow: a narrow Mail.app hides its sidebar and pushes.
The phones and the web are the opposite, and they are the surfaces whose window size ranges from
a phone to a desktop. So `Automatic` and `Sidebar` behave identically on a desktop, and differ on
iOS, Android, HarmonyOS and the web.

`Rail` is not gated by that capability: a narrow sidebar is an ordinary desktop shape, and on
Windows it is what `NavigationView` does at that width. A backend with no rail control rounds it
to a neighbor of its own choosing: macOS has nothing that is a vertical strip of icon-only
destinations, so appkit draws an ordinary sidebar there.

### Page residency

A presentation whose rows are the chrome (`Tabs`, `Rail`) keeps every visited page resident:
switching is a `NavPatch::Select`, nothing is torn down, and each tab keeps its scroll offset and
focused field, which is what every native tab container does. A `Split` or `Stack` presentation
keeps only the shown page and switches by pop-then-push.

Residency follows the presentation rather than the host. Making every nav page resident would
keep effects running for pages nobody is looking at; making none resident would rebuild a tab's
content on every tap. Splitting it this way means a morph only ever disposes pages that are not
on screen, or lazily builds ones that were not built yet; the visible page is never rebuilt,
which is the invariant a morph has to keep. Pages build on first visit.

A chrome presentation is the exception, because its bar needs an item per destination: every page
is built up front, in row order, before the initial selection is applied. `NavPatch::Select` names
a page by attach order while the chrome draws the rows, so page i has to be row i; that pairing
is all a suite has. Building the selected destination first (the selection a `.restore(key)` came
back with, say) would attach it at index 0 and leave the bar highlighting the first row while
another destination's page is the one on screen.

The active key is a `Signal<String>`, two-way exactly like `Picker`/`Toggle`: set it and the UI
switches; the user picking natively writes it back (origin-tagged, no echo).

| Presentation | Native container |
|---|---|
| `Split` | a NavigationSplitView: macOS `NSSplitViewController` with a sidebar `NSSplitViewItem` (system material, source-list `NSOutlineView`, full-height under the titlebar) + detail; GTK `AdwOverlaySplitView` (libadwaita; `DAY_GTK_SPLIT=paned` selects a draggable `GtkPaned` instead); Qt `QSplitter`; iOS `UISplitViewController`; Android `SlidingPaneLayout`. |
| `Stack` | one page at a time, back-navigable: `UINavigationController`, `AdwNavigationView`, the Android back stack, or a desktop back-header above the pages. |
| `Tabs` | the rows drawn as a tab bar: `UITabBarController` / Material `NavigationBarView` / `NavigationView.PaneDisplayMode = Top` / an `NSSegmentedControl` docked below the pages on macOS / a composed bar on Qt and web-dom. |
| `Rail` | the rows as a narrow strip: Material `NavigationRailView`, `PaneDisplayMode = LeftCompact`, an ArkUI vertical `Tabs`; **roundable** where a toolkit has none. |

`nav` is one primitive, a selection-bound switcher, and a presentation is chrome plus page
lifetime rather than a different host. That is why a window crossing a breakpoint re-presents
(`NavPatch::Presentation`) rather than rebuilding: the pages it already has are re-homed, so
nothing loses a scroll offset, a focused field, or an animation in flight.

**What each backend draws.** The rows become the platform's own destination chrome, and where a
platform has no such widget the presentation rounds to the neighbor it does have (`Rail` lands on
an ordinary sidebar on macOS and Qt). A backend that answers `Cap::NavTabs = Unsupported` sends
`Automatic` through the sidebar ladder instead, which is what every backend did before adaptive
navigation existed.

| Backend | Tabs presentation | Adaptive |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| macos-appkit | `NSSegmentedControl` docked below the pages | no; a Mac narrows to a stack |
| ios-uikit | `UITabBarController` in `.tabSidebar` mode, driven by `UITab` on iOS 18+ and by `viewControllers` below it (2026-09) — see below | yes |
| android-mdc | navigation suite: `BottomNavigationView` → `NavigationRailView` → permanent `NavigationView` drawer, by width. A `NavStyle::Sidebar` pane is a `NavigationView` too (2026-09) — see below | yes |
| linux-gtk | `AdwViewStack` under a `.linked` grouped-toggle switcher, docked at the foot | no |
| linux-qt | `QTabWidget` — Qt's own one-of-N container | no |
| web-dom | a composed tab bar (`.day-nav.tabs`) | yes |
| harmony-arkui | a composed bottom bar over resident pages; ArkUI's native node set has no tab container, so it is built from Day's own primitives | yes |
| windows-xaml | the same `NavigationView` with `PaneDisplayMode = Top`; `Rail` is `LeftCompact`, a real rail | no |

Only the phones and the web grow a tab bar as the window narrows (`Cap::NavTabsAdaptive`); a
desktop may pin one with `NavStyle::Tabs`, but narrowing hides its sidebar and pushes.

> [!NOTE]
> **Renamed.** `nav(sel).style(Tabs)` was `tabs()`, and `nav(sel).style(Sidebar)` was `nav()`.

### Keyboard

A sidebar walks with the arrow keys: ↑/↓ move to the next destination, Home and End to the first
and last, and the selection reports exactly what a click on that row reports. The desktops get
this from the widget the style maps to (an `NSOutlineView` source list, a `NavigationView`) with
nothing of Day's in front of it: keys go to whatever has focus and no route sits above them
([docs/menus.md](menus.md)).

**web-dom** has no such widget, so the backend builds the behavior: `.day-navmenu` carries the tab
stop and `role="listbox"`, its rows carry `role="option"` and `aria-selected`, and the shim moves
the selection by reporting the new index the way the click handler does. It also holds the focus
across the page swap its own key press caused: a detail pane can contain an element the browser
focuses as soon as it appears (a `<video>`, a web view's iframe), and without that the sidebar
would answer one arrow and then go quiet.

### Immersive items (`.immersive()`)

`.item(…).immersive()` marks the last-added destination as an immersive-chrome page: on
backends with an immersive nav mode (day-android's edge-to-edge opt-in today) its pushed page
keeps the floating transparent bar over full-bleed content, while unmarked pages and the root
get the standard opaque bar. Every other backend ignores the flag. Pair it with
`day::safe_area()` ([docs/layout](https://daybrite.dev/docs/layout)): the immersive page paints its background unpadded and pads
its content by the reported insets.

## `nav_stack`: push/pop with a value path

```rust
let path = Signal::new(Vec::<String>::new());
nav_stack(path, home_view)
    .destination(|key| detail_view(key))
// push:  path.update(|p| p.push("item-42".into()));
// pop:   path.update(|p| { p.pop(); });
// the native back button writes the pop back into `path` (origin-tagged).
```

Day reconciles the native stack to `path` (keep the common prefix, pop the rest, push the new
suffix; the same diff `NavigationStack`/React-Navigation do). The native containers:
`UINavigationController` (iOS), `AdwNavigationView` (GTK), Android back-stack, and a
top-page-only presentation on macOS `NSSplitView` / Qt `QSplitter` in stack mode. The path is
data, so deep-linking is "parse the URL into a path and `set` it," and the stack is unit-testable
without the framework.

## Commands on the chrome

There is no `bar_action`. A command that belongs on the chrome rather than in the page is a
TOOLBAR ITEM declared on the piece it acts on ([docs/toolbars.md](toolbars.md)), and which bar it
rides follows from that:

```rust
nav(section)
    .toolbar(toolbar_button("add", tr("add")).icon(Symbol::Add).action(add_item))  // the list's
    .destination(|k| page(k).toolbar(share_button()))                              // the page's
```

`Nav::toolbar` and `NavStack::toolbar` put items on that host's own chrome — the sidebar column
where the presentation has one, the root list when it has collapsed. Items declared on a
destination page ride the detail. Both leave the bar when what they act on leaves the screen, so
neither needs a scope to be spelled out.

The affordance that shows and hides the sidebar is the toolkit's, not the app's: a
`nav(Sidebar)` supplies it, and `.sidebar_toggle(false)` suppresses it.

## Data-driven items (`nav().items`)

`nav` items can come from a signal, so a sidebar or tab set grows and shrinks with your data
(a rooms list, open documents). Static `.item`s and dynamic `.items` blocks mix; pair `.items`
with `.destination` to build the page for a data-driven key (like `nav_stack`).

```rust
let tabs = Signal::new(vec!["general".to_string(), "random".to_string()]);
nav(current)
    .style(NavStyle::Tabs)
    .items(move || tabs.get(), |k: &String| item(k.clone(), k.clone()))
    .destination(|k: &String| room_page(k))
```

The row set re-derives whenever a block's signal changes: rows are added/removed on the native
widget, and if the selected key disappears the selection resets (to `None` for an `Option` key).
The same effect resolves every row title tracked, so a runtime `set_locale` retitles the native
rows in place, static `.item`s included.
`item(key, title).icon(name)` is the row spec; `.icon_tint(color)` recolors the row's glyph
([docs/vectors.md](vectors.md)), `.context_menu(vec![…])` attaches a per-row context menu ([docs/menus.md](menus.md)),
and `.immersive()` on it marks that row's pushed page immersive-chrome, same as the static
form above.

`.badge_icon(name)` puts a glyph at the row's trailing edge, with `.badge_tint(color)` for a
color that carries meaning (a starred page's yellow star). It shares the trailing slot with the
text `.badge(…)` and is drawn after it, so a row can show a count and a status at once:

```rust
item(section, title)
    .icon(res::vectors::nav_grid)
    .badge_icon(res::vectors::star)
    .badge_tint(AMBER)
```

Both are template glyphs, so an untinted one takes the backend's neutral row color and follows
the theme; a tinted one keeps its color because the color carries meaning. Every backend draws it:
the trailing slot of the AppKit cell, the GTK row box, a `QStyledItemDelegate` on Qt (a
`QListWidgetItem` has only the leading icon slot), the `end` compound drawable on Android, the
composed `NavigationViewItem.Content` on XAML, between label and chevron on ArkUI, a masked
element on web-dom, and a trailing `UIImageView` on UIKit, which is also where the nav badge slot
first appeared on that backend. A nav host used as a self-contained widget inside a
page that already routes should call `.local()` so it does not add a segment to `current_route` or
intercept `navigate`.

**Section headers.** `nav(…).section(title)` opens a header before the NEXT item added —
a static `.item` or the first row of the next `.items` block — and `item(key, title).section(title)`
does the same from inside a data-driven mapper, which is how a derived list keeps its groups
under a search filter: attach the header to the first surviving row of each group, and a group
whose rows are all filtered out disappears with them. Headers are a grouping hint: a backend
without grouped rows (a tab strip, a plain phone list) shows one flat list, so a header is never
the only way a row is reachable, and a row's icon tint is the grouping signal that survives
there. AppKit draws them as source-list group rows (small, bold, secondary, pinned as their
group scrolls under them); the outline keys its rows by index, not by title, so a header may
share its text with an item ("Controls" over Controls) without the two collapsing into one row.
UIKit and Android draw them from their list's own header slot, described below.

```rust
nav(section)
    .section(res::str::smart_feeds())
    .item_icon("today", res::str::today(), res::images::today, today_page)
    .section(res::str::feeds())
    .items(move || st.feeds.get(), |f| item(f.id, f.name))
```

**A data-driven item is a label + optional icon**: the native sidebar/tab row. It is not an
arbitrary rich row (an avatar + preview + badge); a master list that needs those is a `list`, and
combining a rich master list with native master-detail push is a separate, not-yet-built feature.

**Backend support (2026-07):** dynamic add/remove/reselect renders on `macos-appkit`, `linux-gtk`,
`linux-qt`, and `web-dom` (and their host variants), verified in the showcase walkthrough. The
`ios-uikit` sidebar and tab selection are wired; dynamic rendering on the UIKit/Android/ArkUI/XAML
tab widgets is in progress (those backends ignore the item-set patch until then, so the initial set
still shows). The item logic is backend-independent and covered by
`mock_e2e::nav_data_driven_items_reconcile`.

### The iOS tabs host is driven by `UITab`

A `Tabs` presentation on ios-uikit is a `UITabBarController` in `.tabSidebar` mode, and since
2026-09 its destinations are [`UITab`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitab)
objects rather than a `viewControllers` array of `UITabBarItem`s. Apple's guidance since iOS 18 is
that adopting `UITab` is what gives a tab bar its automatic adaptivity — the tab bar and the
sidebar become two renderings of ONE list of tabs, which is Day's model exactly, and it is what
`.tabSidebar` is built to consume. The array still works, but the controller has to infer
everything from view controllers, and the sidebar-side affordances have no tab to hang on.

Five things this backend learned the hard way:

- **A `UITab` is a model object with an identity, not a per-render descriptor.** Its provider hands
  UIKit a view controller and UIKit then owns that controller as the tab's. This host re-syncs on
  every page insert and every rows change; minting fresh tabs each time left two tabs claiming one
  controller, and UIKit asserts in `-[UITab viewController]` as soon as it resolves the second. A
  tab is created once per page and only its title and glyph are re-applied.
- **The identifier is the PAGE, not the position.** `insert` can put a page in the middle, and an
  identifier is fixed at construction. Day's index is the tab's position in the host's `tabs`.
- **A tab's glyph needs a SIZE, and the ASSET is where it comes from.** A tab bar draws
  `UITab.image` at the image's own size: UIKit scales an SF Symbol to the bar's metrics, but a
  catalog image has no metrics to scale by. A Material Symbols export carries `width="48"
  height="48"` and drew at 48pt, twice the height of an iOS tab icon and overlapping its own
  label. The backend hands the image over untouched and the glyph is authored at icon size
  instead ([docs/vectors.md](vectors.md)): thumbnailing here downsamples the catalog's bitmap
  rendition and throws away the vector representation that put it there. Day-Showcase's Grids
  tabs were the last 48pt holdouts (2026-09-05).
- **A tab switch waits for the visible stack's transition.** Switching tabs hides the outgoing
  tab's navigation controller, and a pop still animating there never finishes once its view has
  left the window: the transition coordinator stays alive, the popped page stays on the stack,
  and every later screenshot reports the UI still settling (Day-Tradr's back-then-switch on
  iOS 27, one walkthrough variant in eight). The selection moves in Day's tree at once; the
  native switch is deferred a few runloop turns until no on-screen stack is transitioning.
- **`didSelectTab:previousTab:` fires for programmatic selection too**, where the old
  `didSelectViewController:` fired only for user taps. It therefore needs the same origin guard as
  every other two-way control here — without it, installing the tabs reported a selection the user
  never made and the app's bound signal followed it.

**Below iOS 18 the same host runs on `viewControllers`.** `UITab` and `setTabs:` are iOS 18's, so
the sync asks the CONTROLLER whether it answers `setTabs:` — the same shape the `.tabSidebar`
`setMode:` probe takes — and where it does not, each page carries its title and glyph on the
`UITabBarItem` UIKit makes for it, the roster goes in through `setViewControllers:`, `Select`
addresses a page by INDEX, and the delegate's `didSelectViewController:` reports a tap. An iOS 17
device therefore gets the plain tab bar an iOS 17 app always had rather than a crash. The
`didSelectTab:previousTab:` method is declared OUTSIDE the delegate's protocol block for the same
reason: a protocol block asks the runtime for the nav host's type encoding, and asking for an iOS
18 nav host on an older runtime fails the class registration itself, which took down the whole
scene as soon as a tabs host was realized.

`UITabGroup` is deliberately NOT used. Day's `NavMenuProps::sections` are headings — "a section
header introducing the row at the same index" — whereas a `UITabGroup` is a destination that
CONTAINS others: in a sidebar it draws as a heading, but in the compact tab bar the whole group
collapses to a single tab. Mapping flat sections onto it would turn N tab-bar destinations into G.
It becomes the right realization if Day's nav host ever grows real hierarchy.

### The iOS sidebar is a collection-view list

`nav(NavStyle::Sidebar)` realizes on ios-uikit as a `UICollectionView` laid out by
`UICollectionLayoutListConfiguration` with the **`.sidebar` appearance**, in the primary column of
a `UISplitViewController`. That appearance publishes the `listEnvironment` trait the cells'
adaptive `UIListContentConfiguration::cellConfiguration` reads, and it is what gives the Settings
sidebar its look: an inset rounded selection pill with a tinted label, and rows with no separators.
A `UITableView` draws its selection edge to edge whatever background configuration its cells carry,
so the rounded shape is the list appearance's to give.

**The list runs under the bars.** A page whose content is one scroll view — this list, a
`scroll`-rooted detail, a tree — fills the page's full bounds, and UIKit's own inset adjustment
starts the content below the navigation bar and lets it pass under the translucent bar and the
bottom search field as it scrolls, as Settings and Mail do. A page whose content is a navigation
host fills its bounds too, because the host passes the bars on to its own pages — which is what
lets a tab's list reach under the tab bar. The window root follows the same rule: a window whose
root is a nav, split or tab host is not padded by the status bar and home indicator, so the bars
reach the screen's edges and the list runs behind them, the way every UIKit app's does. A page holding anything else (a heading over a list, a
form, a canvas) is laid out inside the safe area instead, since it has no scroll insets to absorb
a bar with.

**Section headings ride the same list configuration.** `setHeaderMode(.supplementary)` turns them
on, and a heading is a supplementary view carrying the adaptive
`UIListContentConfiguration::headerConfiguration`, so its type, color and insets come from the same
sidebar environment the rows do. A list that declares no heading sets `.none` instead, so a flat
sidebar reserves no band where a heading would go, and flipping heading-ness re-installs the
layout, header mode being a property of the layout rather than of the data.

The grouping stays private to the list. `NavMenuProps::sections` is parallel to the rows (a heading
introduces the row at its own index), the backend folds that into runs of `(heading, first, len)`,
and `row_of`/`path_of` translate between a flat row index and an `NSIndexPath`. Everything above
the backend — `SelectionChanged`, `NavMenuProps::selected`, the per-row tint and badge arrays —
keeps speaking in flat row indices.

### The Android sidebar is a NavigationView

`nav(NavStyle::Sidebar)` realizes on android-mdc as a Material
[`NavigationView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/navigation/NavigationView),
the class Android means for a standing navigation column. It was a `LinearLayout` of `TextView`
rows in a `ScrollView` until 2026-09, with the 48dp height, the padding, the ripple and the 24dp
leading glyph measured out by hand — a comment called that "the Material nav-drawer idiom", which
it was imitating. The real one brings the M3 row metrics, the ripple, subheaders between
`NavMenuProps::sections` (the flat list dropped them, so eight groups arrived as twenty bare rows),
a RecyclerView so a long sidebar recycles, and the fully-rounded ACTIVE INDICATOR behind the
checked row — which is why `NavMenuPatch::Selected` is no longer a no-op there.

Two consequences worth knowing before touching it:

- **A row's menu id is not its index.** `NavigationMenuItemView` copies its item's id onto ITSELF,
  which puts menu ids and view ids in the one namespace `findViewById` searches — and Day's own
  fragment containers take `View.generateViewId()`, which counts up from 1. Rows keyed by bare
  index collided immediately: `containerId` was 1, the second row became a view with id 1, it sits
  earlier in the traversal than the detail container, and `FragmentTransaction.replace` built every
  detail page INSIDE that sidebar row. Ids start at `ROW_ID_BASE` (0x01000000) for rows and
  `SECTION_ID_BASE` for headings, above `generateViewId`'s ceiling and below aapt's floor.
- **Rows recycle**, so a per-row context menu ([docs/menus.md](menus.md)) cannot be attached once. It goes on
  from `OnChildAttachStateChangeListener`, reading the row a cell is CURRENTLY bound to from its
  own `getItemData()` rather than from its adapter position, which headings and dividers shift.

> [!IMPORTANT]

### How iOS tells a user's back from its own

There is no mirror of the stack on iOS (2026-09-10; before this, day-uikit kept a copy of the
intended stack, re-applied it wholesale on every change, inferred the user's pops from `didShow`
counts through a settle loop, and absorbed Day's answering pops with a counter — and both back
bugs of that month lived in the bookkeeping). UIKit's `viewControllers` is the stack. Two rules:

- **Day's changes are one delta, computed from what UIKit reports.** The insert duty that hands
  a page's controller to the host pushes it (`push_page`: the active controller's current pages
  plus this one, in one `setViewControllers:animated:`), and the remove duty that takes it back
  pops it (`pop_page`: the current pages minus this one). A collapsed triple column is driven
  through UIKit's own column APIs instead (`showColumn`, `popToViewController:`), since a
  wholesale set destroys the bookkeeping its merge keeps. A merge on iOS 26 nests the secondary
  controller onto the primary as one entry, so `day_pages` flattens a nested controller into its
  pages wherever a stack is read. A transition UIKit cancels (a window capture mid-flight does
  that on iOS 26+) is applied once more from its completion.
- **The user's back is observed where it starts.** `DayNavController` overrides
  `popViewControllerAnimated:`, `popToViewController:animated:` and
  `popToRootViewControllerAnimated:`: UIKit routes the back button there once `shouldPopItem:`
  agrees, the swipe there under an interactive transition, and the history menu to the
  `popTo…` pair. Day never calls those for its own changes, and its two pops on a collapsed
  triple column announce themselves (`with_day_pop`), so a call that reaches super is the
  user's. `observe_user_pop` waits for that pop's own transition — a swipe let go early is
  cancelled, and Day hears nothing — and `confirm_user_pop` emits one
  `NavBack { already_popped: true }` per Day page that left. Day answers each by popping its
  model and removing the page, and `pop_page` finds the page already gone: that no-op is the
  whole protocol between the two, and nothing is counted.

`NavPatch::ListInStack` is not consulted here: UIKit's collapse folds the content list onto the
merged stack by itself (the list is the supplementary column's root), and `NavPatch::ListVisible`
shows or pops it there. `NavPatch::Presentation` never reaches a toolkit whose container
re-presents (the pieces layer gates it on `Cap::NavRepresent`).

The guard has the same two doors: `shouldPopItem:` vetoes the button, and the controller is the
swipe recognizer's delegate, whose `gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:` vetoes the swipe; both emit
`NavBack { already_popped: false }` and let Day decide. The gesture is never disabled, so a guard
that proceeds pops through Day's rail and the next swipe works with nothing to re-enable.

`nav_back:` in a walkthrough drives Day's rail and reaches none of this; `nav_back: { native: true }`
presses the bar's button (`Toolkit::native_back` → `DayNavController::press_back`), which asks
`shouldPopItem:` through its selector and pops through the override, so a script covers the code
a tap runs. Trace it with `--env DAY_DIAG_NAV=1`: `user pop levels=1`, `exec SET native=N -> target=M`.

## Back interception (`on_back`)

`NavStack::on_back` intercepts the user's back affordance (a native gesture/button, or `nav_back()`)
to run a policy before the pop. It does not run for a programmatic `path.set` (a write is not a
back), matching Jetpack Compose's `BackHandler`.

```rust
let dirty = Signal::new(false);
nav_stack(path, home_view)
    .destination(|k| detail_view(k))
    .on_back(move |req| {
        if dirty.get() {
            // confirm asynchronously, then perform the deferred pop on "yes"
            day::task(async move {
                if confirm("Discard changes?").await {
                    dirty.set(false);
                    req.proceed();          // performs the pop the guard consumed
                }
            });
            BackResponse::Handled           // consume this back
        } else {
            BackResponse::Proceed           // normal pop
        }
    });
```

The guard returns `Proceed` (pop now) or `Handled` (consume; the pop does not happen). A `Handled`
guard may hold the `BackRequest` and call `proceed()` later: the unsaved-changes → confirm → leave
flow. `proceed()` performs exactly the pop `Proceed` would have.

While a guard is armed above the root, Day tells the toolkit to stop auto-popping on a native
gesture and route the back through Day instead (`NavPatch::GuardTop`). What that means per backend:

| backend | native-gesture arming while guarded |
|---|---|
| iOS (UIKit) | swipe disabled; the back **button** is vetoed via a `UINavigationController` subclass's `navigationBar:shouldPopItem:`, which emits the back to Day |
| Android | a higher-priority `OnBackPressedCallback` routes the system/gesture back and the toolbar up-arrow to Day (the predictive-back preview is unavailable while armed) |
| HarmonyOS (ArkUI) | the top `NavDestination`'s `onBackPressed` consumes the native back and defers to Day |
| GTK | the top `AdwNavigationPage` sets `can-pop = false` (swipe/Escape disabled; the app drives back through its own control, which is guarded) |
| macOS / Qt / XAML / web | no-op — the back button already routes through Day, so the guard runs with no native arming needed |

The guard's logic (intercept, defer, proceed, never-on-programmatic-write) is identical everywhere
and covered by `mock_e2e::nav_stack_on_back_guard_intercepts_and_defers`.

## Routes: the string-route adapter (deep links & dayscript)

Each mounted surface registers a small adapter over its own signal, so a string route can
address the whole tree. The grammar:

```text
route    = segment *( "/" segment ) [ "?" query ]     e.g.  mail/inbox/msg-42?hint=shared
segment  = a nav host/tabs item key, or a stack destination key
query    = name "=" value *( "&" name "=" value )     (params for the destination builders)
```

Reserved characters inside a segment or param value (`/ ? & = %`) are percent-encoded;
`day_core::nav::{parse_route, encode_route}` do this for you. Two addressing modes:

- **A single key is relative**: `navigate("inbox")` reaches the innermost surface first and
  falls through outward. For a `nav`/tabs it sets the active key; a `nav_stack` claims only
  `""` (pop to root), so sibling keys fall through to the enclosing surface. This is what a
  button deep inside a page wants: address the nearest thing that knows the key.
- **A `/`-separated path is absolute**: `navigate("mail/inbox/msg-42")` anchors at the
  outermost surface that knows the first segment, resets every surface inside the anchor to its
  root, then feeds the remaining segments inward. Segments for surfaces that only mount as the
  outer switch takes effect are queued and consumed as those surfaces register. One string
  reaches a stack three levels deep on a cold start. A stack consumes absolute segments
  unconditionally (its destinations are open-ended); the explicit path is the stack's state
  (set-semantics: navigating `mail/inbox` while `mail/inbox/msg-42` shows pops the detail).

**Params** ride the query string: `route_param("hint")` / `route_params()` inside a destination
builder return the values of the navigation being applied. They describe the navigation in
flight; a push you perform by writing the path signal directly carries its data in your own
state instead.

- `nav_back()`: pops the innermost surface, falling through when it is already at its root. On a
  sidebar whose content list is interposed in a collapsed stack, the innermost layer is the
  gated detail: the call closes it (`detail_visible` := false), the same place the native back
  lands, and only a second call leaves the section.
- `current_route()`: the **full** path, every mounted surface's contribution from outermost to
  innermost (`"mail/inbox/msg-42"`). It round-trips through `navigate`, so persisting the *whole*
  route by hand is two lines: save `current_route()` on the way out (day-part-prefs works),
  `navigate(&saved)` after the first mount on the way back. For a single surface, `.restore`
  (below) does the same without the plumbing. dayscript's `assert_route` compares against the same
  full path.
- Startup deep links (`DAY_DEEPLINK`) and warm links (`RouteRequested`) route the
  same way. On hosts with no process environment the platform entry records the launch route
  with `day_core::set_launch_deeplink` instead; web-dom seeds it from the page's URL hash
  ([docs/web.md](web.md)), so `…/#controls` opens on that section. The OS side (scheme registration,
  per-platform intake, and testing) is [docs/deep-links.md](deep-links.md).
- The URL stays live both ways on web-dom: day-core reports every route change to the backend
  (`Toolkit::set_route`: the hash updates as you navigate, one history entry per step), and a
  hash change the app didn't write (browser back/forward, a hand-edited URL) arrives as
  `Event::RouteRequested` and navigates. Other backends inherit the no-op default.

Because each surface owns its own signal, a `nav(Tabs)` or a `nav_stack` nests inside a
`nav(Sidebar)` section with no extra wiring. There is no global navigation controller
to arbitrate, only this string adapter for addressing.

**Sibling one-of-N surfaces need `.local()`.** Every routed surface contributes to the full
route, so *two* `nav`/tabs at the **same level** (a filter tab strip beside a main tab bar)
both feed `current_route()`: you get `section/mainKey/filterKey`, and `navigate("filterKey")` is
ambiguous. Mark all but the primary one `.local()`; it then drives its own signal without touching
the route. A nav host nested one level *deeper* (a `Tabs` inside a `Sidebar` section) is the
opposite case and should stay routed; that cascade is what nesting is for. In debug builds,
two routed one-of-N surfaces at the same level log a warning naming this fix.

**Ordering caveat**: relative dispatch and the full route walk the registry in mount order,
which equals nesting depth for a single active chain. Two *sibling* surfaces mounted at once
(two independent stacks visible in one window) are ordered by mount time, not focus. Prefer
absolute routes (or drive the signals directly) in such layouts.

`day lint` cross-checks literal `navigate("…")` calls and dayscript `navigate:`/`assert_route:`
routes against the declared keys in your sources (`.item("key", …)` call sites and
`routes! { … => "key" }` blocks): a route whose first segment nothing declares is reported
(`day::lint::unknown-route`) rather than failing silently at runtime.

## Restoring state across launches (`.restore`)

When you want a surface to reopen where the user left it, mark it with `.restore(key)`
instead of wiring `current_route()` by hand:

```rust
nav(section).restore("nav.section")   // reopens on the last-viewed section
nav_stack(path, home).restore("mail.path")     // rebuilds the pushed path
```

The selected key (or the stack's `/`-joined path) is saved under `key` on every change and read
back at build. A pending launch deep link **wins**: a `DAY_DEEPLINK` (or a `set_launch_deeplink`
hint) routes one turn after mount, so `.restore` steps aside and the link decides where the app
opens. A saved value that no longer fits (a nav host key whose item is gone, a stack segment that
no longer parses) is ignored rather than restoring a broken state.

`.restore` reads and writes through a store the app installs once at startup; nothing persists
until you install one:

```rust
fn main() {
    day::prefs::install_nav_store();   // before the UI mounts
    // …
}
```

The prefs store is disk-backed, so restore also survives an **Android process death**: the OS
reclaims a backgrounded app and rebuilds it on return, and the value is still on disk. With no
store installed, `.restore` is a silent no-op, so the same code compiles and runs on a target
where you don't want persistence: the Showcase installs the store on web only, where a reload is
routine, and starts fresh on native. To back `.restore` with your own storage, implement
`day_core::NavStore` and hand it to `day_core::set_nav_store`.

## Typed routes

Route keys are data, and strings are their wire format. The `Route` trait carries the
two-way mapping:

```rust
pub trait Route: Clone + PartialEq + 'static {
    fn key(&self) -> String;                  // typed value → path segment
    fn from_key(key: &str) -> Option<Self>;   // path segment → typed value
    fn title(&self) -> String { self.key() }  // native nav-bar title (defaults to the key)
}
```

`title()` is the label a [stack](#nav_stack-pushpop-with-a-value-path) shows in the native navigation bar
for a pushed page. It defaults to the wire `key`, so override it to display a name when the key
is not presentable (e.g. a route that carries only an id can look the name up from your data).

`String` implements it (the untyped baseline: every segment parses), and for plain enums the
`routes!` macro writes both sides:

```rust
day::routes! {
    pub enum Section { Home => "home", Stack => "stack" }
}

let section = Signal::new(None::<Section>);        // None = the collapsed mobile list
nav(section)
    .item(Section::Home,  tr("home"),  home_page)  // compile-checked, no raw keys
    .item(Section::Stack, tr("stack"), stack_page)
```

A sidebar `nav` keys on `Option<Section>` (`None` ↔ `""`, the no-selection list state);
tabs always have a selection, so they key on the bare enum (`Signal::new(Tab::One)`). Blanket
impls cover both: `Option<R>` is a `Route` whenever `R` is, and `.item` takes the bare variant
either way.

**Variants carry data**: this is where typed routes improve on string encoding. Implement
`Route` by hand and put the payload in the variant:

```rust
enum Drill { Depth(u32), Item { id: u32 } }        // "3" ↔ Depth(3), "item-42" ↔ Item{id:42}

let path = Signal::new(Vec::<Drill>::new());
nav_stack(path, root).destination(|d: &Drill| match d {
    Drill::Depth(n)    => level_page(*n),          // parsed, not string-split
    Drill::Item { id } => item_page(*id),
})
// push: path.update(|p| p.push(Drill::Item { id: 42 }));
```

The destination builder receives the parsed value; encode/decode lives in exactly one place
(the `Route` impl). A typed stack also **validates** absolute routes: a segment `from_key`
rejects is refused (the navigation stops there) instead of pushing an unparsed key; a `String`
stack keeps its open-ended accept-anything behavior.

Typed absolute paths compose with `route(…)`, and `navigate_to` is the typed relative form:

```rust
navigate_to(&Section::Home);                       // ≙ navigate("home")
route(&Section::Stack).then(&Drill::Item { id: 42 })
    .param("hint", "linked")
    .navigate();                                   // ≙ navigate("stack/item-42?hint=linked")
nav_link_to(tr("open-42"), route(&Section::Stack).then(&Drill::Item { id: 42 }))
```

Everything downstream is unchanged: `current_route()` still returns the encoded string (which
is what you persist), deep links and dayscript still speak segments, and the two layers meet
only at `key`/`from_key`. Mixed trees are fine: a typed nav host over a `String` stack, or
vice versa.

## Composition

The Mail.app / Files.app pattern falls out by nesting:

```rust
nav(section).style(NavStyle::Sidebar)
    .item("library", tr("library"), || nav_stack(lib_path, library_root).destination(detail))
```

The sidebar selection drives which section shows; the selected section is itself a `nav_stack` that
drills down. Each surface owns its signal.

**Nested stacks share one native container on mobile.** When the enclosing host presents as a
push stack (a phone, or any window too narrow for two panes; see
[size classes](size-classes.md)), a `nav_stack` built inside one of its pages does **not** mint a second native
navigation controller; it pushes its own pages onto the enclosing host, so the whole chain
(list → section → drill-down) is one native stack with a single back button. The inner `nav_stack`
keeps its own path signal and route registration (so `current_route()`, deep links, and
`nav_back()` fall-through are unchanged); only the native container is shared. Where the
enclosing host presents as split panes a nested `nav_stack` is *not* merged; it renders in the
detail pane with its own back-header, which matches the desktop idiom. A resident container
(`nav(Tabs)`) is a merge barrier: a `nav_stack` inside a tab keeps its own host.

## Split or stacked

A `nav(Sidebar)` shows its list beside the selected page in a wide window and pushes the
page over the list in a narrow one. That follows the window, not the platform: it is resolved
from the window's size class and re-resolved whenever the window crosses a breakpoint, so one
`nav` is right on a desktop, a tablet, and a phone. `.presentation(…)` pins it where the
content only works one way. [docs/size-classes.md](size-classes.md) is normative; it covers the
breakpoints, what survives a re-presentation, and which backends morph today.

## The content list (three panes)

> **Status: implemented** (2026-08). Native pane on macos-appkit (a real `contentList`
> `NSSplitViewItem`), on Qt (the middle pane of the navigation `QSplitter`, since 2026-09) and
> ios-uikit (`UISplitViewController` triple-column, merging into the stack at compact width);
> composed by the nav host everywhere else, including the mock.
> `Cap::NavContentList` carries the three-way answer. Since 2026-08 the composed compact flow
> is push navigation: a list-backed tab is a nested navigation controller, not a swap.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A tab bar has nowhere to place the list as a column (on `ios-uikit` a `Pane::List` page
> handed to a `.tabSidebar` controller becomes a stray tab), so a host presenting as tabs is
> never given the native pane. The nav host composes the flow instead, and with
> `detail_visible` the list-backed tab is a navigation controller of its own: the list at the
> tab's root under its own bar and title, the detail pushed over it with a native back. So an
> `Automatic` nav host declares the pane freely; a phone gets all three layers either way
> (the sections, the list, and the detail).

`.content_list(build)` gives a nav host the Mail shape: sidebar, content list, detail
(mailboxes, message list, message). The list is built once and stays resident for the
host's life; its content follows the app's own signals (the sidebar selection scoping it, the
row chosen from it), so switching sections re-scopes it without a rebuild.

```rust
nav(section).style(NavStyle::Sidebar)
    .content_list(timeline_pane)               // the middle column, built once
    .content_list_width(400.0)                 // preferred; drag limits are the backend's
    .content_list_for(|k| k != "settings")     // full-page sections collapse the pane
    .detail_visible(reader_open)               // the compact push gate, two-way
    .detail_title(move || open_title.get())    // the detail layer's bar, live
    .item(…)…
    .destination(…)                            // the DETAIL only — the list is not in here
```

- **Where the pane lands** is `Cap::NavContentList`'s answer. `Native` (macos-appkit, Qt): a
  real pane at every presentation, with a draggable divider on each side; a narrow window
  collapses the sidebar and keeps the list, as a narrow Mail.app does. On Qt the pane is the
  middle of the same three-pane `QSplitter` the sidebar lives in, hidden on a host that declared
  no list, so pane indices and the back header never move. `Emulated` (ios-uikit): a real
  column while expanded that merges into the navigation stack when the host collapses. A
  `UISplitViewController` fixes its column count at creation, never shows the primary without
  the supplementary, and drops a controller re-mounted in another of its columns, so a
  destination without a list gets a double-column host and one with a list a triple-column
  host: a change between the two on a wide window rebuilds the host with fresh column
  controllers and moves the pages across, which is what SwiftUI does when a
  `NavigationSplitView` changes column count. Day's handle for the host is a container the
  split's view fills, so the rebuild never touches the tree. `Unsupported` (everything else): the nav host
  composes the list beside each list-backed destination while split, and as the root layer of
  the gated push flow while compact.
- **`detail_visible` is the compact flow's gate**, two-way like every binding. Wide layouts
  ignore it (the detail pane is always on screen, showing the app's empty state until a row is
  chosen). Stacked, the content list is the top of the stack until the app writes `true` (a
  row was opened); the detail pushes then, and the platform's back writes `false` on the way
  out. In a chrome presentation (a tab bar, a rail) the same flow runs inside the tab: the
  destination's page is a nested navigation host (a `UINavigationController` in the tab, a
  Material toolbar over the fragment back stack), so the tab gets a navigation bar, a title,
  and a native back, and the nav host's bar actions ride that bar (a tabs chrome otherwise
  draws none). Without `detail_visible` a stacked host behaves classically (the detail pushes
  on selection).
- **`detail_title`** names the detail layer's navigation bar: the pushed editor on a phone,
  the detail page's bar wherever the toolkit titles one. Reactive like every title: a closure
  reading your own state retitles the live bar (`NavPatch::Title`) as that state changes, so
  the bar can carry the open item's name. Unset, the detail layer keeps its destination's
  title.
- **`content_list_for`** collapses the pane per destination (`NavPatch::ListVisible`): a
  settings page takes the whole detail area, and selecting a list-backed section brings the
  pane back.
- A host with a content list joins the split's default-selection rule at every presentation:
  the pane needs a selection to scope itself to, so a collapsed host opens on the list rather
  than on bare sidebar rows.
- The native resident pane (`Native`, and `Emulated` while expanded) is a merge barrier like a
  chrome page: a `nav_stack` inside it keeps its own container, with the desktop back header above
  its pages. The composed compact flow is the opposite: there the list is the root page of a
  push stack (the tab's own navigation controller, or the enclosing host's), so a `nav_stack` inside
  it merges, and a drill-down from the list (a category, then its stations) is real pushes with
  the native back, with the gated detail pushed on top of whatever the stack pushed.

Keyboard: pair the list's content with `.focusable()` + `.focused(sig)` + `.on_key(…)`
([docs/focus.md](focus.md)) so the arrows walk the selection, and a `scroll_target` signal
(`ScrollTarget::Id`) to keep the selected row in view.

## Backend notes

- **GTK** adopts libadwaita throughout (`adw::Application` loads the Adwaita stylesheet). The
  window is an `AdwApplicationWindow` whose content is an `AdwToolbarView` (an `AdwHeaderBar`
  supplies the title, window controls, and drag; Day's content sits below it). Navigation:
  `Sidebar` → `AdwOverlaySplitView` with `AdwNavigationPage` sidebar/content; `nav_stack` →
  `AdwNavigationView` (push/pop + back gesture; its `popped` signal writes native back into the
  path). Page content is a `GtkFixed` wrapped in an `AdwNavigationPage`; Day sizes it from the
  host width (sidebar is a fixed width, detail fills the rest). The split's **content** pane puts
  a `GtkScrolledWindow` (policy `External` on both axes) between the two, purely to stop Day's
  laid-out width from becoming a GTK minimum, the same device the window root uses, and the same
  need `GtkPaned` covers with `set_shrink_*_child`. Without it, framing the detail to the whole
  host on collapse left the split no room to park the sidebar off screen at its own width, so
  libadwaita collapsed the sidebar to zero and the reveal animation had nothing to slide back in. Tabs use an `AdwViewStack` with a
  `.linked` toggle switcher; dialogs use `AdwAlertDialog` ([docs/dialogs.md](dialogs.md)).

- **macOS `NSSplitView` / Qt `QSplitter`** honor the resolved presentation: `Split` shows both panes; a
  `nav_stack` collapses the empty sidebar and stacks every page (top visible) in the detail pane,
  with a **back header** (chevron + centered title, hidden at the root) above the pages;
  desktop has no system back affordance, so a pushed page carries its own way out. The button
  emits the same `NavBack` event mobile back does, writing the pop into the path signal.
- **Android** hosts each page in an androidx **Fragment** that retains its Day-owned view
  (the react-native-screens pattern: the FragmentManager owns when a page shows, Day owns
  what it shows). A push is a `replace()` back-stack transaction carrying `MaterialSharedAxis`
  transitions, which gets the whole back behavior from the platform:
  `OnBackPressedDispatcher` dispatches hardware/gesture back on every API level, the
  FragmentManager **seeks the pop transition live under the predictive back gesture** on API
  34+ (progress, cancel, commit), and its back callback is enabled only while the back stack
  is non-empty, so the system's predictive back-to-home animation stays available at the
  root (apps opt in with `android:enableOnBackInvokedCallback="true"`; the scaffold does).
  Native pops are reported to Rust as `NavBack { already_popped: true }`; Rust-initiated pops
  run `popBackStack`. When testing on Android 13/14 (API 33/34), the system gates
  predictive-back animation behind Developer options → "Predictive back animations"
  (`adb shell settings put global enable_back_animation 1`), and gesture navigation must be
  active; Android 15+ enables it by default.
- **Mobile** presents the host as a native stack for both `Sidebar` (collapsed) and `nav_stack`. A
  `nav_stack` nested inside such a host's page merges into it (one `UINavigationController` /
  `DayNavHost`, one back button) rather than nesting a second controller; see Composition. No
  backend change is involved: the shared host receives NAV_PAGE pushes/pops from both the outer
  surface and the inner stack identically to a single-surface stack.

## Testing

`crates/day-pieces/tests/mock_e2e.rs`: nav host tabs/sidebar two-way binding, stack
push/pop/reconcile, native-back-into-path, deep-link, nested fall-through, and typed routes
(a `Signal<Option<Area>>` sidebar over a data-carrying `Leg(u32)` stack, including segment
validation). The showcase's top-level nav is a typed `nav(Sidebar)` over a `Section`
enum, its Tabs page a typed `nav(Tabs)`, and its Stack page a `nav_stack` over a
data-carrying `Drill` enum, all driven through the walkthrough on all five local targets.
