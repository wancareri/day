## The dayscript step: `web_eval`

```yaml
- web_eval:
    id: reader-web
    script: "document.getElementById('reader-title') ? 'reader-ok' : 'no-title'"
    text: "reader-ok"
```

This step is the scripted face of the same machinery. It proves a page rendered, where
`assert_visible` only proves the native view exists (an error page or a blank document passes
that, and both have). `script` runs through the identical envelope and reply channel as
`JsHandle::eval`; a string result compares as itself, anything else as its JSON text.
`contains:` asserts a substring, `text:` an exact match; with neither, a successful
evaluation alone passes.

The plumbing is a three-party handoff with no new dependency edges: the webview piece
registers an evaluator with day-core (`register_webview_eval`, keyed by its node kind) from
its constructors, and the step drives it via `day_core::webview_eval`; day-script and the
piece never learn about each other. Because a step handler cannot block the event pump its
reply needs, the step is a retryable poll: the first pass starts the evaluation, retries
within the runner's implicit wait collect it, and an assertion mismatch discards the result
so the next retry re-evaluates; a page mid-load settles into passing within the wait. It
fails non-retryably when the id names no web view (or no webview piece is linked), and
spends the wait then fails where the backend's arm reports `Unsupported`; gate it with
`only_on:` to the platforms in the support list above.

Goal: `js.eval("document.title").await` returning a value from the embedded engine, on every backend
that has one.

## The short answer

Every backend with a real engine offers the same primitive: submit a script string, get one value
back asynchronously, on the UI thread. They differ in the error channel, the value type, and
whether the callback is guaranteed to arrive at all. Three lowest common denominators fall out,
and they drive the design:

1. **The value is a JSON string.** Android, WebView2 and ArkUI only ever produce one.
2. **The error channel must be built in JavaScript**, because Qt and Android have none.
3. **Delivery is at-most-once**, because Android and WebView2 drop pending callbacks on teardown.

¹ `callAsyncJavaScript` / `WKContentWorld`, macOS 11 / iOS 14.
² `call_async_javascript_function`.
³ The `GCancellable` converts the completion to `Err(CANCELLED)`; the script still runs.
⁴ Qt fires pending callbacks with an invalid `QVariant` during page destruction, a stronger guarantee than
the other backends give.
⁵ ArkUI's generic piece channel originally hardcoded `num = 0.0`; `pieceEvent` gained an
optional third argument (added for the inline web view's link reports), which carries the
request id now.

The axes where backends differ are the axes a naive API would expose. Everything below is about collapsing them.

## Per-platform detail

### Apple — WKWebView (appkit, uikit)

Two methods. `evaluateJavaScript:completionHandler:` (macOS 10.10 / iOS 8) evaluates a *program* and
yields the completion value of the last expression. `callAsyncJavaScript:arguments:inFrame:inContentWorld:completionHandler:`
(macOS 11 / iOS 14) wraps the body in `(async function(…){…})`, so `await` works, promises are awaited,
thenables are resolved, and arguments pass structurally instead of by string interpolation. The async
form requires `return`; the plain form forbids it.

Errors arrive as `NSError` in `WKErrorDomain`:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 4 `JavaScriptExceptionOccurred` | the script threw, **or** a promise rejected |
| 5 `JavaScriptResultTypeIsUnsupported` | value can't cross IPC (function, DOM node, un-awaited Promise) |
| 12 `JavaScriptInvalidFrameTarget` | target frame vanished mid-navigation |
| 14 `JavaScriptAppBoundDomain` | blocked by app-bound domains |

`userInfo` carries `WKJavaScriptExceptionMessage`, `…LineNumber`, `…ColumnNumber`, `…SourceURL`. Read
those by literal string key; the `_WK…ErrorKey` symbols are SPI and must not be linked.

Value mapping: `undefined` → nil with no error; `null` → `NSNull`; numbers are **always** doubles;
`Date` → `NSDate`; `Map`/`Set`/`Error` → empty dictionaries. Cyclic objects **succeed** and produce a
self-referential `NSDictionary`, which will hang `NSJSONSerialization`. That alone argues
for stringifying in JS rather than marshaling `id` graphs.

Code 5 is overloaded: a dead web content process also reports it, with empty `userInfo`. Disambiguate
on the presence of `WKJavaScriptExceptionMessage`.

Both methods must be called on the main thread; the handler is documented to always run there, and
never re-entrantly. There is no cancellation of any kind.

Availability note: `objc2-web-kit` binds `WKWebView` for **macOS only**, so the UIKit arm must send
these by nav host, exactly as it already hand-rolls the rest of its `WKWebView` usage.

### GTK — WebKitGTK 6

`WebViewExt::evaluate_javascript(script, world_name, source_uri, cancellable, callback)` and a
`…_future` variant. Errors are real: domain `WebKitJavascriptError`, code 699 `SCRIPT_FAILED` for a
thrown exception, with the message pre-formatted as `"<source_uri>:<line>:<col>: <message>"`, so `source_uri`
is worth passing even though it doesn't affect execution.

`JSCValue::to_json(indent)` returns `Option<GString>`, and `None` is ambiguous across `undefined`, a
function, and a cyclic object. Worse, the cyclic case leaves a **latent exception on the `JSCContext`**
that poisons the next operation unless cleared with `context.clear_exception()`.

Any non-`NULL` `world_name` creates a distinct isolated world. The binding asserts it is called on the
thread owning the default `MainContext`, and the closure is thread-guarded, so dropping it on another
thread aborts. Cancellation is result-side only.

### Qt — QWebEngineView

`QWebEnginePage::runJavaScript(script[, worldId], callback)`, with `worldId` 0 = main, 1 =
`ApplicationWorld`. The overloads became templates in Qt 6.12, so the shim should pass a bare lambda
rather than an explicit `std::function` to compile on both sides of that change.

**There is no error channel.** A thrown exception, a syntax error, an unsupported return type, a
discarded page and a real `null` all arrive as the same default-constructed, invalid `QVariant`.
Qt reports these to stderr via `qWarning` instead. `web_contents_adapter.cpp` confirms that Qt
works this way; no fix is pending.

Qt does guarantee the callback runs even during page destruction (with an invalid value), so a
boxed Rust closure is always reclaimed exactly once. The matching hazard is that touching the
`QWebEnginePage`/`QWebEngineView` inside that late callback is undefined behavior, so the shim
lambda must capture PODs only.

Values round-trip through Chromium's `base::Value`, so `Date` arrives as a string and `1` vs `1.0`
can differ in `QVariant` type. `QJsonDocument::fromVariant` is lossy for top-level scalars, which is
a second reason to stringify in JS.

### Android — android.webkit.WebView

`evaluateJavascript(String, ValueCallback<String>)`, API 19, so unconditionally available at Day's
`minSdk = 24`. Both the call and the callback are on the UI thread, and Chromium posts the callback
to a fresh looper turn rather than invoking it inline.

**No error channel.** A thrown exception and a returned `undefined` both produce the literal string
`"null"`. Two quirks beyond that: when JSON writing fails the callback receives the **empty string**,
which is not valid JSON and must be treated as an engine failure; and cyclic objects null only the
*repeating member* (`{"self":null}`) rather than throwing as `JSON.stringify` would.

Delivery is at most once. If the WebView is destroyed first, `AwContents` early-returns and the
callback **never fires**, so a pending-request map leaks without a timeout.

### Windows — WebView2 (xaml)

`ExecuteScriptAsync` reports `"null"` for everything, as Android does.
**`ExecuteScriptWithResult` on `ICoreWebView2_21` fixes it**: `Succeeded`, `ResultAsJson`, and
an `ICoreWebView2ScriptException` carrying name, message, line and column. Because it works at the
engine level rather than in JS, it also catches **syntax errors**, the one case the JS envelope
below cannot.

It arrived in SDK 1.0.2277.86; the piece already pins 1.0.3179.45, so the header is present. The
*runtime* is not guaranteed, so probe with `try_query<ICoreWebView2_21>()` and fall back to
`ExecuteScript` plus the envelope. `get_Exception` returns `S_OK` even when acquisition fails, so
null-check the out-pointer rather than the `HRESULT`.

Callbacks run on the creating UI thread, serially, never re-entrantly. `Close()` releases pending
handlers, so delivery is at most once.

### HarmonyOS — ArkUI

`WebviewController.runJavaScript(script)` returns `Promise<string>` (API 9). `runJavaScriptExt`
(API 10) returns a `JsMessageExt` with typed getters including `getError()` and a `JsMessageType::ERROR`
variant, which appears to be the only way to recover a JS exception. Controller calls fail with
`17100001` unless the controller is attached to a live `Web`, so evaluation must be gated on
`onControllerAttached` or later.

Both facts marked ? in the matrix are unverified, because official documentation endpoints were
unreachable during this research. Settle them against the installed DevEco SDK's `@ohos.web.webview.d.ts` before
implementing. This arm also cannot be tested on the x86_64 emulator at all, because `ArkWebCore.hap`
carries arm64-only native libraries.

### web-dom — iframe

Cross-origin evaluation is impossible. `iframe.contentWindow.eval(...)` throws `SecurityError`, the same wall that
blocks history and URL readback. Same-origin content could be evaluated, but the piece cannot know the
origin ahead of time and the failure is silent, so this arm reports the capability as unsupported and
does not try.

## The design

### 1. Wrap every script, and `eval` it from a string literal

This single decision lifts Qt and Android to roughly the error fidelity of WebKit, and normalizes
value marshaling on all seven backends. The shipped wrapper passes the script to `eval` as an
escaped **string literal** rather than splicing it in as source. Unlike splicing, that also
catches syntax errors and accepts statements (`throw …`, `var a = 1; a + 1`), because `eval`
compiles at run time inside the `try`. The cost is that a page whose CSP omits `unsafe-eval`
refuses it, reported as a legible caught error. The original spliced form is kept below for
contrast:

```js
(function(){try{var v=(/*USER*/
);return JSON.stringify({ok:1,v:v===undefined?null:v,u:v===undefined})}
catch(e){return JSON.stringify({ok:0,n:(e&&e.name)||"",m:(e&&e.message)||String(e),s:(e&&e.stack)||""})}
})()
```

The result is therefore always a *string*, which every backend can carry, and which JSON-encodes to a
quoted string at the outer layer. Day parses twice. The double encoding means the outer
parse succeeds whenever the engine worked at all, so an empty string or an outer parse failure
becomes an unambiguous engine-level failure rather than being confused with a script-level one.

The wrapper has to account for these cases:

- **A syntax error in the user script is not caught**, because the wrapper and the script compile
  as one unit. Only WebView2's `ExecuteScriptWithResult` reports it natively. `new Function(...)` would move
  compilation inside the `try` but breaks under a CSP without `unsafe-eval`, so it is not the default.
- **Emit a newline before the closing braces**, or a trailing `//` comment in the user script swallows
  them.
- **`JSON.stringify` drops unserializable values**, so a missing `v` key means "returned something
  unserializable" and is distinct from `"v":null`.
- **Cycles now throw** and get reported, where the raw Android API silently nulled a member.
- **`BigInt` throws** in `JSON.stringify`.
- **Wrapping adds a function scope**, so top-level `var` and function declarations no longer leak to
  `globalThis`. Scripts that set up global state need the unwrapped path.

Two evaluation modes follow: `Expression` (the wrapper above) and `Statements` (the body becomes an
IIFE and the caller writes `return`).

### 2. Correlate on `Event::Custom`'s `num`

`Event::Custom { tag, num: f64, text }` is the documented open channel, and `num` already survives
every native boundary except one. Correlation ids start at 1; `f64` is exact to 2^53.

This keeps the whole mechanism inside the piece. The alternative (a dedicated `Event` variant with a
`req` field, intercepted in `pump_events_inner` before node dispatch, as `Event::PresentResult` does)
is the house pattern for correlated results, but it would require day-core and `BridgeKind` to learn
about an *external* piece's feature. That is the wrong direction for something that exists to be
implementable without touching day.

Two consequences follow.

- **The URL readback collides and must be fixed first.** `lib.rs` currently treats *any* `Custom` on
  the node as the URL, and its comment says so. URL reports keep `num == 0.0`; eval replies use
  `num >= 1.0`; the handler branches. Without this, an eval result overwrites the user's URL bar.
- **ArkUI needs a two-line framework fix.** `day-arkui-sys`'s `PieceEvent` passes a literal `0.0`, and
  the ArkTS-facing `pieceEvent(id, text)` has no `num` parameter. The Rust decode already forwards
  `num`, so widening the shim to `(id, num, text)`, defaulting to `0.0` when `argc < 3`, is the
  whole change. This also makes ArkUI match Android, which has carried `num` all along.

### 3. Mirror `day_core::present`

Eval completions all arrive on the UI thread, so the future is `Rc`/`RefCell` with a stored `Waker`,
like `day_core::present`, rather than `day-part-http`'s `Arc`/`Mutex` (which exists because HTTP
completes on a background thread). Register lazily in `poll` so nothing is dispatched until awaited,
resolve by looking the id up in a thread-local map, and follow [`docs/async.md`](async.md)'s rule that a piece
offers a callback *and* a future and never calls `on_main` itself.

Because no backend can cancel a running script, `Drop` deregisters the pending id so a late reply is
a silent no-op. The script keeps running; the result is discarded. The API docs must say so.

Because delivery is at most once on Android and WebView2, **every pending request needs a timeout**,
and the map must be drained when the node is disposed. `pump_events` also clears the whole
in-flight batch if any handler panics, which would strand sibling requests; that is a second
reason the timeout is mandatory.

### 4. Surface, sketched

```rust
let js = JsHandle::new();
web_view(url).js(js);

day::task(async move {
    match js.eval("document.title").await {
        Ok(json) => …,                        // "\"Daybrite\""
        Err(EvalError::Threw { message, .. }) => …,
        Err(EvalError::Unsupported) => …,     // web-dom
    }
});
```

```rust
pub enum EvalError {
    Unsupported,                                   // no engine, or web-dom
    Threw { name: String, message: String, stack: String },
    Unserializable,                                // ran, value could not cross
    Timeout,
    ViewGone,
    Engine(String),                                // could not run or decode
}
pub enum EvalWorld { Isolated, Page }              // honored on apple/gtk/qt, ignored elsewhere
pub enum EvalMode  { Expression, Statements }
```

`EvalWorld` is a hint rather than a guarantee, because Android, WebView2 and ArkUI have no world
concept, and an isolated world cannot read page globals on the backends that do. Default to `Isolated` and let callers
opt into `Page`.

A separate `eval_support()` is needed alongside `support()`: the two axes have diverged, since the dom
arm loads pages but cannot evaluate at all.

## Implementation order

1. **Front-end** — `WebPatch::Eval { req, script }`, the envelope builder, the pending map, the future,
   `eval_support()`, and the `num`-based fix to the URL handler. Testable against day-mock with a
   programmatic responder, mirroring `present`'s dayscript escape hatch.
2. **GTK** — cheapest real arm. No new dependencies; `webkit6` is already there and re-exports
   `javascriptcore`. Handle `to_json` returning `None` by checking and clearing the context exception.
3. **Apple** — add `block2` to the `appkit` and `uikit` features, plus the explicit `objc2-web-kit`
   features (`WKContentWorld`, `WKError`, `block2`) and `objc2-foundation` features (`NSError`,
   `NSDictionary`, `NSValue`, `NSNull`) that the lists currently omit. Factor the result marshaling into
   a shared file included by both arms, since only dispatch differs.
4. **Android** — `DayWebView.webEval(view, id, corr, script)` calling `evaluateJavascript` and reporting
   through `DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, 12, corr, value)`. No new Gradle dependency, no day-android edit.
5. **Qt** — two new C-ABI functions in *both* branches of the shim. The `#else` no-engine branch must
   define them too, or windows-qt fails to link; that is the most likely way this breaks CI.
6. **XAML** — **done.** `ComPtr::As<ICoreWebView2_21>` with an `ExecuteScript` fallback, `find_ctx`
   guard, `CoTaskMemFree` on every out-string. The sketch above did not anticipate two details.
   `TryGetResultAsString` returns the wrapper's string directly, so the success path needs no JSON
   walk at all (the same shape Qt's `QVariant` and WebKit's `NSString` hand back); the
   *fallback* path returns the result as JSON, so it needs a real JSON string decoder including
   `\u`, because the protocol's own `` separator arrives escaped.
7. **ArkUI** — the `PieceEvent` widening first, then the arm. Verify on arm64 hardware.

## Open questions

- Whether a JS exception rejects HarmonyOS's `runJavaScript` promise or resolves it to `null`, and
  whether `runJavaScriptExt` is the only way to recover an error object.
- Whether WebKitGTK still invokes the callback when `WebKitSettings:enable-javascript` is false. The
  docs say the method "will do nothing"; do not assume the callback arrives.
- Any practical script-length ceiling on Android's Mojo transport. None is documented.
- Whether Apple's cycle-preservation and `Map`/`Set` → empty-dictionary behavior hold on releases
  older than the 2025 `JavaScriptEvaluationResult` rewrite. The envelope makes this moot in practice.
