# Tweaks: per-toolkit configuration of built-in pieces

A **tweak** configures the native widget behind a Day-created piece: the extra `NSButton` or
XAML `Button` method call that doesn't justify a whole custom piece. A piece with a tweak applied is
a **Tweaked Piece**. Day keeps owning the widget's lifecycle, layout, and managed properties; the
tweak reaches in through the same handle Day manages.

Tweaks slot between styling and native pieces in the extension ladder:

```text
styling            .font/.background/…                portable, limited surface
tweaks             .tweak / per-toolkit ext traits    the native widget, case by case   ← this doc
native pieces      renderer! per toolkit              a NEW widget kind
```

## The portable surface

Everything below builds on two prelude items and one function:

```rust
// Runs once at mount, AFTER the native widget exists. The realized node is your key
// into the per-toolkit accessors below.
button("Save").tweak(|node| { /* … */ })

// Retained access for later (event handlers, timers). Clears on unmount; reads are
// REACTIVE (a binding that calls r.node() re-runs on mount/clear transitions).
let r = NativeRef::new();
slider(v).native_ref(&r);
r.with(|node| { /* … */ });          // None once the piece is disposed

// After any native call that changes the widget's intrinsic size:
day::invalidate_size(node);
```

## Per-toolkit access

Each toolkit crate has an `ext` module with a typed (or raw) accessor and a matching
`Decorate` extension trait. Those traits return `day_pieces::Decorated<Self>`, like every other
modifier, so a tweak does not erase the piece's type and can be chained on either side of a typed
builder ([docs/api-style.md](api-style.md) "Typed builders and erasure"). The support tiers:

Every accessor hands the closure the native widget **and its concrete class name** (a `&str`),
then whatever context that toolkit needs:

| toolkit | accessor | closure gets | tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppKit  | `day_appkit::with_native` / `.appkit(…)` | `&Retained<NSView>`, `class`, `MainThreadMarker` (objc2 `downcast_ref` to the class) | typed |
| UIKit   | `day_uikit::with_native` / `.uikit(…)`   | `&Retained<UIView>`, `class`, marker | typed |
| GTK     | `day_gtk::with_native` / `.gtk(…)`       | `&gtk4::Widget`, `class` (`downcast_ref` to the class) | typed |
| Android | `day_android::with_native` / `.android(…)` | `&GlobalRef`, `class`, attached `&mut JNIEnv` | typed (JNI) |
| Qt      | `day_qt::with_native_raw` / `.qt_raw(…)` | the raw `QWidget*`, `class`; bring your own C++ (below) | raw |
| XAML   | `day_xaml::with_native_raw` / `.xaml_raw(…)` | the **borrowed** `IUIElement*` ABI pointer, `class`; bring your own C++/WinRT (below) | raw |
| ArkUI   | `day_arkui::with_native_raw` / `.arkui_raw(…)` | the raw `ArkUI_NodeHandle`, `class`; NDK C API | raw |

The `windows` crate ships no `Windows.UI.Xaml` bindings, which is why XAML is a raw tier: the
pointer is real and the C++/WinRT recipe below is short, but there is no typed Rust surface to
hand you.

```rust
// Inline, per-toolkit (each trait exists only under its backend's cargo feature):
use day_appkit::AppKitExt;
button("Save").appkit(|view, class, _mtm| {
    // `class` is "NSButton" here — see "Knowing the native class" below.
    if let Some(btn) = view.downcast_ref::<objc2_app_kit::NSButton>() {
        unsafe { btn.setBezelStyle(objc2_app_kit::NSBezelStyle::Toolbar) };
    }
})
```

### Knowing the native class

A tweak has to know *what* it is poking. Day realizes each piece as a specific native widget, and
the accessor hands you that widget's concrete class name:

- **Typed tiers** (AppKit/UIKit/GTK) report the *live* widget's runtime class: objc
  `object_getClass` (`"NSSlider"`, `"UILabel"`), GTK's GType name (`"GtkScale"`). Because it reads
  the real object, it stays correct even when a piece has a **conditional backing**, which is no
  longer hypothetical: a `.selectable()` label on UIKit is realized as a read-only `UITextView`,
  because `UILabel` has no selection support to switch on ([docs/text.md](text.md)). The class tells you
  which one you got, and a `downcast_ref` you'd have guessed wrong is avoided:

  ```rust
  label(text).selectable().uikit(|view, class, _mtm| match class {
      "UILabel"    => { /* the plain backing */ }
      "UITextView" => { /* the selectable backing (and any future rich/link one) */ }
      _ => {}
  });
  ```

- **Raw tiers** (Qt/XAML/ArkUI) can't be introspected from Rust (the handle is an opaque
  pointer), so Day reports the class it realized for the node's kind (`"QSlider"`, `"Slider"`).
  This is the piece of metadata that lets your C++ cast the pointer *knowingly*: pass the class
  across the FFI and guard the cast instead of a blind `static_cast` (see the recipes below).

Android reports the Java class its `DayBridge` factory realizes (`"android.widget.TextView"`,
`"com.google.android.material.slider.Slider"`). The name is `""` for layout-only nodes and for
kinds whose stored handle is a container rather than a single leaf widget.

### Conditional backings: the contract

The native class behind a piece is **not part of Day's API**. Day picks the best class for the
piece's current modifiers on each platform, and that choice can change with a modifier (a
`.selectable()` label on UIKit), with a platform version, or with a Day release. SwiftUI works
the same way underneath: when iOS 16 moved `List` from `UITableView` to `UICollectionView`,
hardcoded `UITableView` casts stopped matching, and swiftui-introspect handles that with
per-OS-version pins on every view type. Day owns realization, so the accessor reports the
concrete class of the live widget and keeps the node's handle pointed at whatever is on screen,
and no version pinning is needed. Three rules keep a tweak on the right side of that contract:

1. **Match the class, don't assume it.** Branch on the reported `class` (or use a guarded
   `downcast_ref`) as in the example above. An unrecognized class must fall through to a no-op;
   that is also how a tweak stays quiet on a Day release that changes a backing.
2. **Order tweaks after rebuilding modifiers.** Decorators run in chain order at mount, and
   `.selectable()` may *rebuild* the widget (UIKit). A tweak chained before it runs against the
   widget the rebuild discards, and Day logs a warning when that happens; chained after, the tweak
   sees the widget that ships. When in doubt, tweaks go last in the chain.
3. **Prefer the widest surface that expresses the intent.** A mutation on the common superclass
   (`UIView`/`NSView` alpha, layers, tooltips) lands identically on every backing and survives a
   swap without a branch; reach for the concrete class only when the intent needs it.

`NativeRef` is immune to all of this: it stores the node rather than the widget and re-resolves
the handle on every call, so after a swap it hands you the replacement. That is one
more reason the rules below say to hold a `NativeRef` rather than a handle clone.

## Packaged tweaks (`day-tweak-*` crates)

For anything reusable, package the tweak: an ordinary crate whose modifier applies the native
calls per toolkit and **no-ops where it has no coverage**; the consuming app writes no
`#[cfg]`. Four in-tree examples span the range:

| crate | scope | demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| `tweaks/day-tweak-button-bezel` | AppKit only | the minimal shape: one enum of symbolic constants, one setter |
| `tweaks/day-tweak-tooltip` | AppKit, GTK, Android | one modifier across three access tiers (objc2 / gtk4-rs / JNI) |
| `tweaks/day-tweak-slider-tickmarks` | AppKit, GTK, Android, Qt, XAML, ArkUI | a configurable feature (`Tickmarks { count, snap, position }`), including the crate's own Qt C++, WinRT C++, and NDK C++ |
| `tweaks/day-tweak-tree-style` | AppKit, GTK | styling a composite control's subcontrols (`with_native_subcontrol` reaches the `NSOutlineView` inside the tree's scroll host; GTK adds a CSS class to the `GtkListView`) |

The Cargo shape mirrors piece crates: per-backend `[features]` gating optional deps, plus

```toml
[package.metadata.day.piece]
backends = ["appkit", "gtk", "mdc", "qt", "xaml", "arkui"]
```

so `day build` unions `<crate>/<backend>` into the app's features automatically (Tier A.2,
`crates/day-cli/src/pieces.rs`). Apps that build with bare cargo wire the features explicitly,
as `Day-Showcase/Cargo.toml` does.

## Bring-your-own native code (the raw tiers)

Pass the `class` the accessor gave you across the FFI so your C++ can guard the cast; Rust can't
type the pointer for you, but it can tell you what it is.

**Qt.** The handle is the `QWidget*`. Compile a few lines of C++ in your crate's `build.rs` with
`cc` + `pkg-config Qt6Widgets` (Qt itself is already linked by day-qt-sys):

```rust
slider(v).qt_raw(|w, class| {
    let cls = std::ffi::CString::new(class).unwrap();
    unsafe { my_ticks(w, cls.as_ptr(), 10) };
});
```

```cpp
#include <QtWidgets/QSlider>
#include <cstring>
extern "C" void my_ticks(void* w, const char* cls, int interval) {
    if (!w || !cls || std::strcmp(cls, "QSlider") != 0) return;   // told what it is
    auto* s = static_cast<QSlider*>(w);
    s->setTickPosition(QSlider::TicksBelow);
    s->setTickInterval(interval);
}
```

**XAML.** `with_native_raw` hands you a *borrowed* ABI pointer via the shim's `day_xaml_unbox`
function, plus the class. In your C++/WinRT (compiled with `cc` against the Windows SDK's cppwinrt
headers; mirror `tweaks/day-tweak-slider-tickmarks/build.rs`):

```cpp
#include <cstring>
extern "C" void my_ticks(void* abi, const char* cls, double freq) {
    if (!cls || std::strcmp(cls, "Slider") != 0) return;
    winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::UIElement e{ nullptr };
    winrt::copy_from_abi(e, abi);                       // AddRef for this call's duration
    auto s = e.try_as<winrt::Windows::UI::Xaml::Controls::Slider>();
    if (s) s.TickFrequency(freq);
}
```

**ArkUI.** The handle is the NDK `ArkUI_NodeHandle` and the class is the node type name
(`"Slider"`); resolve the node API with `OH_ArkUI_GetModuleInterface` and `setAttribute` away (see
`tweaks/day-tweak-slider-tickmarks/src/ticks-arkui.cpp`).

## Rules

- **Main thread only:** Tweaks run at mount (already on the main thread); `NativeRef::with` from
  anywhere else is a checked no-op on Apple (`MainThreadMarker`) and undefined elsewhere; don't.
- **Tweaks go last in the chain**, after any modifier that can rebuild the backing widget
  (today `.selectable()`, see "Conditional backings" above). A tweak chained before the rebuild
  pokes a widget that gets discarded, and Day warns at runtime.
- **Never destroy or reparent** the widget; Day owns its lifecycle. Don't hold raw pointers or
  handle clones past the call; hold a `NativeRef` and re-resolve.
- **Never set a delegate or data source** on a widget Day drives. Day's object makes
  the piece work (`list` and the sidebar's `NSOutlineView` both install one), so replacing it
  tears the data out from under the piece. Pieces whose native widget decides things through a
  delegate expose those decisions as their own hooks instead (see
  [docs/tree.md](tree.md) for the worked example).
- **Managed properties can be clobbered.** Day re-applies what it manages (title, value, enabled,
  frame, a11y) on its next patch of that node. Unmanaged properties (bezel styles, tick marks,
  selectability) are stable. If you must re-assert, do it from an `Effect` or event handler via
  `NativeRef`.
- **Size changes need `invalidate_size(node)`**: Day cannot see native mutations it didn't make.
- **Document coverage:** a packaged tweak lists its per-toolkit coverage (and quirks like
  "Material sliders always snap when stepped"); where it has no coverage
  it must be a silent, safe no-op.

## How it works

`Toolkit::Handle` is `Clone + 'static`; the object-safe tree interface exposes
`node_handle_any(node) -> Option<Box<dyn Any>>` (a clone of the handle: a retain / gobject ref /
`GlobalRef` clone / `Copy` pointer), and each toolkit's `ext` module downcasts to its concrete
handle type. The **class name** rides alongside with no new trait method: typed tiers introspect
the downcast handle directly (objc `object_getClass`, GTK `type_().name()`), and raw tiers read the
node's semantic kind from the same interface (`node_kind`) and map it to the native class Day realized
for it. `.tweak` is an ordinary decorator: build the piece, hand the node to the closure, by which
point `realize` has already run. `NativeRef` is a `Cell<Option<RNode>>` plus a reactive `Trigger`,
set at build and cleared by the piece's scope cleanup; slotmap generations make a stale node a
clean `None` rather than a dangling pointer.
