# Search (`searchable`)

Search is declared on the **surface**, not on the toolbar.

```rust
nav host(section)
    .style(NavStyle::Sidebar)
    .searchable(query)                   // Signal<String>, two-way
    .search_prompt(tr("search-sections"))
    .items(move || destinations_matching(query.get()), row)
```

That decision makes the rest work. Because the surface owns the declaration and the
app owns the `Signal`, the toolkit is free to draw the field wherever its platform puts search (in
the window toolbar on a wide window, attached to the navigation list on a narrow one), and
moving it never moves the state. The app filters its own rows from its own signal either way, and
never branches on where the field went.

This is the same move SwiftUI made with `.searchable()`, for the same reason.

## The modifiers

| modifier | what it does |
|---|---|
| `.searchable(query)` | makes the surface searchable, bound two-way to `query` |
| `.search_prompt(text)` | the empty-state prompt |
| `.search_placement(p)` | a placement **preference** (see below) |
| `.search_scopes(scope, titles)` | a one-of-N scope bar, bound to `scope` |
| `.search_suggestions(f)` | completions for the current text |

## Placement is a preference

`SearchPlacement::{Automatic, Toolbar, Inline}` states a preference. A backend that cannot
honor the request falls back to its platform's own convention, as SwiftUI documents
("depending on the containing view hierarchy and platform, the requested placement may not be able
to be fulfilled"). `Automatic` is almost always the right answer: it lets the field live in
the toolbar on a desktop window and move into the navigation list on a phone.

`Automatic` resolves to the window toolbar wherever the toolkit has one, and to **`Inline`** where
it does not. That second case needs no size class, because "this toolkit has no toolbar at all" is
a static fact about the backend rather than a question about the window's width.

On **iOS the two placements name one surface**, so the resolution does not matter there:
`UINavigationItem` owns the navigation bar's buttons AND its search controller, and the window
toolbar rides that same item ([docs/toolbars.md](toolbars.md)) — so day-uikit installs the field
whichever way it was asked for. It has to: the day iOS gained `Cap::Toolbar` (2026-09), every
`.searchable()` surface there resolved to `Toolbar` and the field silently vanished, because a
`UIBarButtonItem` cannot be a search field and the toolbar builder skipped it.

> [!NOTE]
> **The case in between still waits on size classes**: a narrow window on a toolkit that
> *does* have a toolbar. Until that lands, a narrow desktop window keeps its field in the toolbar
> ([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)).

### Inline, per platform

Each platform keeps its own convention.

| backend | where | resting state | how it is revealed |
|---|---|---|---|
| ios-uikit | `UISearchController` on the root page's `navigationItem` | visible, pinned under the title | always there (`hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling` off) |
| android-mdc | Material `SearchBar` above the nav list | visible, scroll-away | always there; returns on scroll up |
| harmony-arkui | ArkUI `Search` atop the nav list | visible | always there |

iOS PINS the field rather than hiding it behind a pull-down (2026-09). The hide is a phone
idiom — a list that owns the whole screen can trade the field for a row of content — and a sidebar
is not that: it is a narrow permanent column beside the detail it filters, and a field you have to
know to pull for is one nobody finds. Deciding it per presentation would mean asking
`isCollapsed`, which answers nothing on a host that has not met a window yet and never changes
again on a device that only ever has one shape, so the field's presence would turn on whether a
rotation happened to fire. One rule at both sizes, with a large title above it — a standard iOS
configuration either way.

Android has **no** `hidesSearchBarWhenScrolling` equivalent. Material's `SearchBar` supports
fixed / scroll-away / lift-on-scroll through `CoordinatorLayout` behaviors, but scroll-away hides
on scroll down and returns on scroll up; there is no pull-past-the-top reveal. Forcing the iOS
gesture onto Android would make a Day app the only one on the device that behaves that way.

Day uses `SearchBar` **without** expanding it into Material's full-screen `SearchView`.
`SearchView` is an overlay showing its own results list, and on a searchable navigation surface
the list underneath is already the result set, so the overlay would mean maintaining a second
copy of it.

## One model, one writer

`SearchProps` on the nav host holds the state for every placement. The toolbar item a
desktop backend draws is a rendering of it and carries no state of its own:
both inbound transports (a toolbar value callback, or `Event::SearchChanged` from an inline field)
write the app's `Signal`, and one outbound binding patches whichever target the resolved placement
renders into.

That will make a placement change tractable. The state does not live in the widget, so
re-rendering into the other target is a patch rather than a rebuild, the same property that makes
the navigation host re-presentable. The remaining step for the size-class work is a
`SearchPatch::Placement` that swaps the render target on a live host; until it exists, placement is
resolved once at realize and cannot change ([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)).

## How the toolbar placement is realized

Day hands the resolved field to day-core as an ordinary `ToolbarItemKind::Search` item, which is
merged into the window's bar under the reserved id **`day.search`**, trailing. This has two
consequences:

- every backend that already drew a toolbar search field draws this one, with no per-backend code;
- the merge happens inside `set_window_toolbar`, not at the app's call site, because the app
  installs its bar *before* the tree builds and a derived contribution re-lowers on
  any reactive change. An item injected once would be dropped by the next rebuild.

dayscript addresses the field by that id: `toolbar: { item: day.search, text: "…" }`.

## Scopes are not drawn yet

`.search_scopes()` is in the API and lowers correctly, but **no backend draws a scope bar yet**,
because a scope bar has nowhere to live at the Toolbar placement: it belongs *below* the field, and
Day's toolbar model is a flat list of items with no "below the bar" slot. The field currently sits
inside an `NSSearchToolbarItem` / an `AdwHeaderBar` entry / a `QToolBar` widget, none of which can
host one.

Scopes therefore wait on the **Inline** placement, where the field is attached to the navigation
surface and the bar can sit under it. When they land, the per-backend mapping is:

| backend | scope bar | `Cap::SearchScopes` |
|---|---|---|
| ios-uikit | `UISearchBar.scopeButtonTitles` | `Native` |
| android-mdc | `ChipGroup` of single-selection filter chips | `Emulated` |
| harmony-arkui | `SegmentButtonV2` | `Emulated` |
| macos-appkit | `NSSegmentedControl` | `Emulated` |
| linux-gtk | `.linked` toggle buttons | `Emulated` |
| linux-qt | a button row | `Emulated` |
| web-dom | a radio group | `Emulated` |
| windows-xaml | a `ToggleButton` row (system XAML has no `Segmented`) | `Emulated` |

`Emulated` covers two different situations there: a real native component doing this job (the
chips, `SegmentButtonV2`, `NSSegmentedControl`) and a bar composed from primitives (web, XAML).
Neither claims to be the platform's own scope bar.

## Suggestions complete the field

On a navigation surface the list **is** the result set. So `.search_suggestions()` offers
completions that fill the field; it does not open an overlay of results, which would cover the
list it is narrowing.

Day uses the search widget's own completion affordance, and only that: a completion popup Day drew
itself would not match the platform's keyboard handling or styling, and a search field that behaves
differently from every other one on the system is worse than no completions.

| backend | completions |
|---|---|
| linux-qt | `QCompleter` (native popup, case-insensitive) |
| web-dom | `<datalist>` (the browser's own popup) |
| windows-xaml | `AutoSuggestBox.ItemsSource` |
| ios-uikit | `UISearchResultsUpdating`, at any placement — see below |
| macos-appkit | **none.** `NSSearchField`'s menu is a recents list, not completions for the current text, so Day does not present it as one |
| linux-gtk | **none.** GTK4 deprecated `GtkEntryCompletion` and `GtkSearchEntry` has no replacement |
| android-mdc, harmony-arkui | with the Inline placement |

Choosing a suggestion puts it in the field and emits the same change any keystroke would, so an app
that only reads `query` needs no extra handling. `Event::SearchSuggestionChosen` says *which* one,
for an app that wants to act on the choice itself.

## What is searchable

`Nav` today. A `nav_stack` gains the same surface when the placement resolver lands, since it is the
same lowering. Search on arbitrary page content is out of scope, because every backend
would need a placement answer for content that is not navigation chrome.

## Two-way, through the signal

Both directions go through the app's `Signal`, never through the widget:

- the user typing emits `Event::SearchChanged`, which writes the signal;
- the app writing the signal patches the live field (`SearchPatch::Text`) rather than rebuilding
  it, so a sync never steals focus or resets the insertion point mid-word.

That discipline will let the field change placement later without the query noticing.
