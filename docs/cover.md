# Fullscreen cover (`cover`) & the system-gesture shield

> **Status: implemented on every backend** (2026-07). Native fullscreen modal on ios-uikit;
> window overlay + slide transition on android-mdc; a topmost full-window child (`Cap::Cover` =
> `Emulated`: no transition, no interactive dismissal) on harmony-arkui, macos-appkit, gtk, qt,
> xaml, and web-dom; probe-visible patches on mock. The emulated tier defaults to an opaque
> theme-background surface so a cover always occludes the window. Exercised end-to-end by Day-Games (a grid home page
> whose tiles present each game fullscreen) and `mock_e2e::cover_presents_lays_out_and_dismisses`.
>
> **macos-appkit (2026-09).** The cover filled the full-size content view, so its content ran
> under the window's title bar. It now starts above the pinned content origin (so its surface
> color still paints edge to edge under the bar) and lays its content out below the bar, the
> size it reports through `FrameChanged` (DESIGN.md §7.7).
>
> **gtk (2026-09).** The emulated cover took the root `GtkFixed`'s allocation for its size,
> and that Fixed sits in an External-policy scroll wrapper that allocates it its children's
> bounding box, so a small home page (Day-Games' 2×2 tile grid) presented a cover the size of
> the grid. The cover now takes the wrapper's allocation, the window content area.

A `cover` presents a Day subtree over the whole window (edge-to-edge, above every other
surface): the SwiftUI `fullScreenCover(item:)` shape. Like `nav` and `nav_stack`
([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)), it is a projection of an app-owned signal, not an imperative controller:

```rust
let open = Signal::new(None::<Section>);          // Section: any Route type
zstack((
    home_page(open),
    cover(open, |section| game_page(*section))
        .background(|section| section.surface_color()),
))
// present:  open.set(Some(Section::Breakout));
// dismiss:  open.set(None);                       // e.g. from an in-content close button
```

- `Some(r)` builds `build(&r)` under the cover and presents it (slide-up where the platform
  animates modals). `None` dismisses it. Switching directly from `Some(a)` to `Some(b)`
  swaps the content and re-presents.
- `.background(f)` paints the surface color edge-to-edge (under the status bar and home
  indicator) while the content itself is laid out inside the safe area. Without it the
  platform's default surface color shows in the unsafe regions.
- The builder runs inside the presented content's scope: state it restores, signals it
  creates, and cleanups it registers (e.g. a save-on-exit) live exactly as long as the
  presentation.
- The content is disposed only after the backend reports the hide transition finished
  (`Event::CoverHidden` on the cover node), so the surface never blanks mid-animation.
  Scope cleanups (the natural save-on-exit hook) run at that moment.

### The `CoverHidden` delivery contract

App teardown hangs off this one event, so its delivery is a hard guarantee, not a
best-effort animation callback:

- **Backends must deliver it after every dismissal**, even when the platform loses the
  animation completion (UIKit drops transition completions under scripted bursts; Android
  cancels `withEndAction` when an animator is superseded). Both backends pair the normal
  completion with a delayed backstop that reports once the surface has verifiably left the
  screen.
- **The piece treats it as idempotent and orderable**: duplicates are no-ops, and a belated
  report from a previous dismissal cannot dispose content presented since (the closing
  gate). Backends may therefore over-report freely rather than risk under-reporting.
- The mock-toolkit e2e (`cover_cycle_keeps_siblings_alive_and_represents`) pins present →
  dismiss → re-present across double and late reports.

## The shield modifiers

Two `Decorate` modifiers protect a fullscreen interaction (a game, a drawing canvas) from
accidental exits. Both are registration-scoped: they apply while their subtree is mounted
and lift when it unmounts.

```rust
game_page()
    .defers_system_gestures(Edges::ALL)   // SwiftUI defersSystemGestures(on:)
    .interactive_dismiss_disabled()       // SwiftUI interactiveDismissDisabled()
```

- **`defers_system_gestures(edges)`** asks the OS to require a second swipe for its edge
  gestures on the given `Edges` (TOP/BOTTOM/LEADING/TRAILING/ALL). iOS defers the chosen
  screen edges (`preferredScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` on the root and cover view
  controllers); Android enters swipe-to-reveal immersive mode while any request is live;
  desktop backends no-op. day-core keeps the union of all mounted requests and re-sends it
  through the `Toolkit::defer_system_gestures` duty on every change.
- **`interactive_dismiss_disabled()`** blocks the *user-initiated* dismissal of the
  enclosing cover: Android's system back stops closing it (iOS sets
  `isModalInPresentation`, inert under the fullscreen style). Programmatic writes
  (`open.set(None)`, dayscript `nav_back`) still close it; ship an explicit close control.
  The state is queryable via `day_core::shield::dismiss_disabled()` (reactive: reads track
  a change counter).

## Routes, dayscript, deep links

A mounted cover registers a string-route adapter ([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)): `navigate("<key>")`
presents the parsed route, `nav_back()` dismisses, and the presented key is the cover's
contribution to `current_route()`. Day-Games' walkthrough drives games with plain
`- navigate: { route: breakout }` / `- nav_back:` steps.

### `.unrouted()`: a cover that belongs to a control

`cover(open, build).unrouted()` skips that registration: `navigate("<key>")` does not reach it, it
contributes nothing to `current_route()`, and `nav_back()` walks past it. Interactive dismissal is
unaffected; Android's system back arrives as `Event::NavBack` on the cover's own node, which
never went through the adapter.

Reach for it whenever the cover belongs to a **control** rather than to the app: a color picker's
chooser ([docs/colorpicker.md](colorpicker.md)), a scrubber's fullscreen mode. Two things go wrong
otherwise.

The sharper problem is that a routed cover claims route segments through `R::from_key`, and the
untyped route is `String`, whose `from_key` accepts **anything**. So a routed `cover(Signal<Option<String>>, …)`
claims every segment: mount one, and the app's next `navigate("settings")` presents that cover
keyed `"settings"` instead of going to settings. A piece that mounts a cover would be silently
rewriting its host app's navigation, which is what happened to the showcase's walkthrough
the first time the color picker's panel went in. A typed `Route` enum does not have this problem,
because its `from_key` rejects what is not its own; `.unrouted()` is the fix when the key is a
string, and the right answer regardless when the surface is not a destination.

The quieter problem is that `current_route()` naming a transient chooser makes a restored session
reopen it, and a "link me to this screen" URL point at a modal.

## How it works

- `kinds::COVER` is realized detached from the visible hierarchy (its `set_frame` is a
  toolkit no-op: the frame is native-owned). `CoverPatch::Present { background,
  dismiss_disabled }` shows it; `CoverPatch::Dismiss` hides it; `CoverPatch::
  DismissDisabled` tracks the shield while presented.
- Layout follows the nav-page contract: the backend reports the content container's
  safe-area size via `Event::FrameChanged`, and `CoverLayout` (day-core) lays the children
  out at that size. In the tree the cover node measures 0×0, so it never disturbs the
  layout it sits in.
- A native dismissal *request* (Android back) arrives as `Event::NavBack` on the cover
  node; the piece writes `None` into the signal unless dismissal is disabled, the same
  origin-tagged write-back discipline as every control.

## Per-toolkit realization

| Toolkit | Present | Dismiss request | Hidden report |
|---|---|---|---|
| uikit | `DayCoverVC` (fullscreen modal) over a `DayNavPageView`, through the dialog FIFO | none (fullscreen has no sheet gesture) | dismiss completion block |
| android | `DayCover` shell re-homed onto the activity content root, slide-up `ViewPropertyAnimator` | `OnBackPressedCallback` → `NavBack` | slide-out end action |
| arkui | Stack re-homed onto the window root at full bounds (no transition) | none | posted immediately on dismiss |
| mock | patch recorded (`flag` = presented) | tests emit it | tests emit it |
| appkit / gtk / qt / xaml / dom | topmost full-window child of the window content, opaque theme background by default (`Cap::Cover` = `Emulated`, no transition) | none | posted immediately on dismiss |
