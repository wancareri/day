# Web: the web-dom backend (§9)

Day's ninth backend renders in a browser. The DOM is the toolkit: a Day `button` is a real
`<button>`, a slider is `<input type="range">`, and a dialog is `<dialog>`, all semantic HTML
plus ARIA. The backend is `toolkits/day-dom`, the target name is
`web-dom`, and the feature is `dom`. Status: **experimental**
([Tier 3](https://daybrite.dev/docs/platforms#support-tiers)); the capability subset below is
implemented, and the known gaps are listed at the end.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
day build  -p web-dom     # wasm cdylib + host page → build/day/cargo/web-dom/<profile>/dist/
day launch -p web-dom     # build, serve dist/ on 127.0.0.1, open the default browser
day launch -p web-dom --locale ar    # locale rides as ?locale= on the URL
```

The Rust target is the whole toolchain for a UI-only app. An app with the `persistence` feature
also needs a C compiler with a wasm32 backend: day-persistence's web driver compiles the bundled
SQLite to WebAssembly ([docs/persistence.md](persistence.md)). Open-source LLVM clang has the
backend; Apple's Xcode clang does not, so `day build` probes plain `clang`, then Homebrew LLVM
(`brew install llvm` is enough; the keg is probed directly, without any PATH setup), then
[swift.org toolchains](https://www.swift.org/install/), and exports the first wasm-capable one
as `CC_wasm32_unknown_unknown` for the build. Setting that variable (or `CC`) yourself picks
the compiler, honored as-is. `day doctor --toolkit dom` reports which compiler the build will
use.

## Architecture

It has the same trampoline shape as the Android and HarmonyOS backends, with JavaScript in place
of Java/C. A plain ES-module shim owns every real DOM call; Rust holds numeric element ids and
crosses the boundary with `extern "C"` imports. The shim is plain JavaScript that the page loads
directly, so the toolchain is rustc alone.

```
index.html                        app.wasm (Rust cdylib)
  #day-root                        day-dom   (Toolkit/Platform over the shim imports)
  shim.js  ──instantiate──▶        day-core / day-pieces / day-fluent
     │  env.day_dom_create/insert/set_frame/…   (imports: the DOM verbs)
     └── wasm.day_dom_main/event/posted/frame/… (exports: entry + callbacks)
```

- **`toolkits/day-dom/src/lib.rs`** — the `Toolkit`/`Platform` impl. Pieces map to elements
  (`<div>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<progress>`, `<img>`, `<canvas>`, `<dialog>`…);
  layout stays day-core-owned `position:absolute` frames, with two exceptions below.
- **`crates/day-cli/resources/web/`** — `shim.js` (the DOM half: element table, event dispatch,
  canvas replay, dialogs, text measurement, the day-sql channel), `day-sql-worker.js` (SQLite
  over OPFS for day-persistence, [docs/persistence.md](persistence.md)), `day.css` (control
  styling, light + dark via CSS
  custom properties), `index.html` (fetches and instantiates the wasm). The trio lives in the CLI
  rather than beside the toolkit because `day build` embeds it with `include_str!` (so an
  installed CLI needs no source checkout) and `include_str!` may not reach outside its own
  package. **Editing shim.js means rebuilding the CLI** before the change reaches a served page.
- **`day::day_start_web!(root)`** — exports `day_dom_main`, which `shim.js` calls once the module is
  instantiated. Emits nothing off wasm32, like the other entry macros (§17.4). Apps reach it
  through `day::day_start!("App Name", root)`, which expands to this macro and to every other
  platform's entry, one line in `lib.rs` covering all of them.
- **Logging** ([docs/logging.md](logging.md)) — `day_dom_log(level, ptr, len)` is the console
  bridge: `error!`/`warn!`/`info!`/`debug!` land on the matching `console.*` method, so devtools'
  level filter applies to Day's output. This is the only sink a page has, because std's stdout on
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` accepts bytes and drops them, so a bare `println!` in a Day app is
  silent here, which is why the framework and the scaffold both log through `log`. It is
  hand-rolled rather than `console_log`/`wasm-logger`, because both need `web-sys` and one of
  them `wasm-bindgen`, which this backend does not use.

The browser owns geometry in two places:

- **Scrolling** maps to `overflow:auto` containers (DP-8's hybrid, as proposed): day children
  are absolutely placed inside a sized content `<div>`, the browser scrolls it natively.
- **Nav and tab panes** are CSS-framed (flex split view, stacked pages); each pane reports its
  size back through a ResizeObserver as `Event::FrameChanged`, the DayNavPage contract
  ([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)). Split-vs-stack for a `nav(Sidebar)` is decided once at launch from
  the initial viewport width (`SPLIT_MODE`, ≥ 700 px) and never re-evaluated on resize; a
  window widened past the threshold stays a stack until reload.

Synchronous text measurement (the one duty a browser makes hard) uses a hidden measurement
element (so wrapping matches real labels), cached per element and invalidated on text or font
patches.

A label with [styled runs](text-runs.md) is measured from clones of its spans rather than its
flat text: a bold span is wider than the same words in the base font, and measuring the flat
text under-counted a wrapped paragraph by a line, which clipped its last word (2026-09).

**Typography is rem-based, scaled per form factor.** The style ramp (`font_rem` in day-dom) is the
Apple text-style ratios with `Body` = 1, and a step becomes a length through one multiplier:
day-dom emits `calc(<step>rem * var(--day-text-scale))`, so day.css's `--day-text-scale` is the only
place the size is decided, with nothing in Rust to keep in step with it. Controls (and the picker
measurer, `measure_str`) take the same expression at `Body`, as on every native toolkit, where a
button's caption and a label are one size.

The scale differs by pointer type, because a point means different things on a desktop and a phone:

| | `--day-text-scale` | `1rem` | `Body` |
|---|---|---|---|
| desktop (default) | 0.8125 = 13/16 | the browser's font-size preference (`html` is pinned at `font-size: 100%`) | 13px, one CSS pixel per Apple point, the size AppKit gives a desktop app |
| `pointer: coarse` | 1 | `-apple-system-body`, which on iOS *is* Dynamic Type | 17px on iOS and tracking "Larger Text"; 16px where the keyword is unknown (Android has no Dynamic Type to track) |

Before 2026-08 one scale of 1.12 served both, which put a desktop browser on the phone ramp: `Body`
came out at 17.9px and the whole UI read about a third larger than the same app on macOS. Nothing
may redefine `html`'s size outside that media query, because 1rem *is* the reader's preference;
that is how web-dom delivers the accessibility text scaling [docs/text.md](text.md) promises, and page zoom applies on
top of it. Chrome metrics that wrap text (the sidebar row's padding and icon) are in `em` for the
same reason: they follow the font instead of pinning a desktop row size onto a touch device.

Canvas draw-op text is the exception, because it renders in the app's coordinate space, where
scaling text but not geometry would corrupt drawings.

## The main loop, timers, and `day::sleep`

The browser owns the loop; wasm has one thread, and `std::thread`, `Instant`, `SystemTime`,
and the process environment are all absent. Three substitutions make Day code run unchanged:

- `Platform::post` queues a microtask; `Platform::request_frame` is `requestAnimationFrame`
  (animation clocks tick per frame, and CSS transitions carry opacity/transform/color).
- `Platform::post_delayed(ms, f)` (new with this backend, default = thread + sleep on native)
  is `setTimeout` here. It backs **`day::sleep(ms)`**, the awaitable timer for
  `day::task` flows. Use it instead of `std::thread::sleep` for fake-work delays and it works
  on every backend ([docs/async.md](async.md)).
- The launch locale reaches localization through `set_launch_locale` (the `?locale=` query
  parameter, else the browser's language list) because there is no `DAY_LOCALE` environment
  variable to read.

## Capabilities

What the subset covers today: containers, labels, buttons, toggles, sliders, text fields and
areas, all three picker styles, progress and spinners, images, dividers, scrolling, canvas
(shapes, gradients, text, transforms; replayed onto `<canvas>` 2D), split + stack navigation
with back bar, tabs, the emulated recycling list with multi-selection, alert/confirm/prompt
dialogs (`<dialog>`), fonts bundled via `FontFace` with a generated `fonts.json`, localization
including RTL mirroring, dark mode, lifecycle (`DidBecomeActive`/`WillResignActive` from page
visibility), routes in the URL (below), day-part-prefs backed by `localStorage`
([docs/prefs.md](prefs.md), so app state bound through `day::prefs::bind` survives a reload), and
day-part-http backed by the browser's `fetch()` ([docs/http.md](http.md)): `fetch_async` and
`fetch_future` work in full, with drop-cancel through an `AbortController`; the blocking
entry points return `Unsupported` (one thread, no blocking waits). day-persistence file
databases work in full through the day-sql worker ([docs/persistence.md](persistence.md)),
and the open/save file pickers are the browser's own file input and download
([docs/files.md](files.md)).

## Routes in the URL

The app's route and the URL hash stay in step, both ways ([docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)):

- **Loading `…/#controls`** opens on that section: the host page hands the hash to
  `set_launch_deeplink`, the web spelling of `DAY_DEEPLINK`.
- **Navigating in the app** updates the hash through the `Toolkit::set_route` duty: one
  history entry per step, so browser back/forward walk the app's navigation. The launch
  reflection replaces the current entry instead of pushing one.
- **A hash change the app didn't write** (back/forward, a hand-edited URL) arrives as
  `Event::RouteRequested` and navigates; echoes of the app's own updates are dropped on both
  sides of the boundary.

Routes are the same strings every platform speaks: `day::routes!` keys and `/`-separated
paths (`#mail/inbox/msg-42` works like `navigate("mail/inbox/msg-42")`).

## dayscript on the web

`day launch -p web-dom --script …` and `day drive` work like every other target. The engine
runs inside the wasm; the page opens a WebSocket to the dev server's `/dayscript`, and the
server bridges it to the plain TCP protocol the runner already speaks (§14.5), so one script
runs on every platform. The differences from native are all internal:

- The engine's implicit bounded wait reschedules through the delayed poster instead of
  sleeping (one thread, no `Instant`); replies arrive when the step settles.
- The in-page `screenshot` step reports unsupported (a DOM cannot rasterize itself), so the
  runner captures through the **`DAY_WEB_DRIVER`** browser instead: set it to a command line
  (e.g. `node $(day web driver)`, the CLI's bundled headless-Playwright driver) and `day` spawns it as
  `<cmd> <url> <control-port>`; the driver serves `GET /screenshot` (PNG) and `GET /quit` on
  the control port. The bundled driver opens a throwaway persistent profile
  (`launchPersistentContext`), not Playwright's default ephemeral context; WebKit gives an
  ephemeral session no OPFS backing, and day-part-fs is OPFS-only ([docs/fs.md](fs.md)). Its engine
  comes from `DAY_WEB_DRIVER_BROWSER` (`webkit` default, `chromium`, `firefox`): macOS WebKit
  has OPFS and is the local default, but Playwright's Linux WebKit (the WPE port) ships no
  OPFS at all, so Linux CI runs the walkthrough under Chromium. Without a driver, scripted
  runs fail at the first screenshot; interactive `day launch` never needs one.
- Storage lasts exactly as long as the launch: the driver's profile is created for the run
  and removed at quit, and the loopback origin's port changes per launch, so no OPFS state
  survives from one `day launch` to the next the way a native target's on-disk store does.
  Scripts that hand state onward (a seed script before a walkthrough) must ride one
  launch as repeated `--script` flags, which runs them in sequence against the same
  instance (and is how the CI workflow runs a multi-script `scripts:` input on web-dom).
- Steps for capabilities the web lacks (the native file pickers) carry
  `skip_on: [web-dom]` in the walkthrough; the runner drops them for this target
  (DESIGN.md Appendix C). The HTTP demo runs unskipped: the dev server answers the
  same-origin `/day-http-ok` echo endpoint (below) with the same bodies the native demo's
  loopback server serves.
- Day element ids double as DOM ids (via the a11y identifier duty), so the page is
  inspectable with the same ids scripts use.

CI runs the full showcase walkthrough this way (light/dark × en/fr/ar/zh-CN) and publishes
the captures in the website gallery's "Web DOM" column.

Known gaps, in rough order of interest:

- **Bundled data assets** — `resource()` returns `None` (no synchronous file reads in a
  browser). Images and fonts work; raw asset bytes need an embedding mode that does not exist
  yet.
- **App menus and context menus** — no DOM equivalent of a native menu bar; unsupported.
- **Native pieces** — webview, map, lottie, combobox, searchfield and activity render their
  standard placeholder. `day-piece-media` now renders a real `<video>` ([docs/media.md](media.md)): the browser
  supplies the transport chrome, so a URL is required (a file path cannot load) and autoplay needs
  `.muted(true)`. `day-piece-colorpicker` renders `<input type="color">`
  ([docs/colorpicker.md](colorpicker.md)), the browser's own picker, which on desktop is the system
  chooser; its value is 8-bit `#rrggbb`, and the `alpha` attribute is set but honored only where the
  browser has shipped it. The registry is open for the others: day-dom exposes a runtime renderer registry
  (`day_dom::register_renderer`) rather than the `linkme` distributed slice the other eight backends
  use, because `#[distributed_slice]` does not compile for wasm32; a piece self-registers from its
  own constructor. A piece that needs to report back asks for the shim's listeners with
  `Dom::listen(&handle, listen::INPUT)`, the same wiring the built-in kinds get, exposed for
  pieces alongside `element` / `set_attr` / `call`. Parts other than prefs, http, sensors and location (battery,
  clipboard, haptics…) answer their unavailable tier. `day-part-sensors` streams the accelerometer
  and gyroscope from `DeviceMotionEvent` (no cross-browser magnetometer exists; [docs/sensors.md](sensors.md)),
  `day-part-location` rides `navigator.geolocation`, and `day-part-permissions` answers from
  `navigator.permissions`. All three need a secure context, and iOS Safari's motion prompt must be
  requested from inside a button action while the user gesture is still live.
- **day-break** — no signal handlers on wasm; init succeeds and every API degrades to its
  documented stub.
- **Window control** — the page can set `document.title`; size, minimum size, and multi-window
  do not apply.

## Home screen and offline

The dist is an installable web app: added to a home screen from Safari on iOS, Chrome on
Android, or any browser that follows the W3C Web Application Manifest, it gets its own icon and
name, opens without browser chrome, and launches with the network away. `day build` writes the
pieces beside `index.html`:

- **`manifest.webmanifest`** — the name and short name, the description, the language, the
  display mode, the theme and background colors, and the icons. Every URL in it is relative
  (`./`, `icons/…`), so the one file serves from a Pages root, a project subpath, or a project
  site's `webapp/` directory, and its `id` is the resolved start URL wherever it lands.
- **`icons/icon-{64,192,512}.png`** — from the png family `day icon` renders; 192 and 512 are
  the sizes an install needs, and the 512 doubles as the maskable icon since the master's
  background layer fills the square. A project without an icon master ships no icons and the
  manifest lists none.
- **The head of `index.html`** — the title, the manifest link, one `theme-color` per
  appearance, the favicon and apple-touch-icon links, and the iOS home-screen metas Safari
  still reads for the status bar and the title.
- **`sw.js`** — the offline shell. Its cache is named by a digest of every file in the dist,
  filled with all of them at install, and served network-first: the network's answer when there
  is one (refreshing the cache), the cache's when there is not, and `index.html` for any
  navigation neither can answer. A rebuild changes the digest, so the next visit installs a
  fresh cache and drops the old one; `day launch` sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, so a dev
  page never sees a stale worker. Same-origin GETs inside the worker's scope only.

The texts come from where they already live: the name and short description from
`store/<default locale>/` ([docs/store.md](store.md)), falling back to `[app] title`, and the
language from the default locale. `[web]` in Day.toml holds the few things nothing else knows,
all optional:

```toml
[web]
short-name = "Showcase"        # under the icon; default: the name, or its leading words within 12 characters
theme-color = "#ffffff"        # browser chrome, light appearance (default)
theme-color-dark = "#000000"   # dark appearance (default)
background-color = "#123246"   # the splash while the app loads; default: the light theme color
display = "standalone"         # standalone | minimal-ui | browser | fullscreen
```

The worker registers only on `https:` and loopback, which browsers require anyway; a plain
`http:` host serves the app as before, without the offline shell. Scripted runs
([dayscript on the web](#dayscript-on-the-web)) are unaffected: the worker passes every
request through while the network is up, and the bridge is a WebSocket, which it never sees.

## Serving and static hosting

The dist directory is self-contained static files that any host can serve as they are. The only
reason `day launch` runs a server at all is that browsers refuse to instantiate wasm from `file:`
URLs; any static host works, including GitHub Pages. One
capability rides on response headers rather than files: the day-sql worker's
SharedArrayBuffer channel ([docs/persistence.md](persistence.md)) exists only on
cross-origin-isolated pages, so `day launch` sends `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, and a static host must send the same two
headers for file databases to persist. A host that cannot set headers (GitHub Pages) still
serves the app; day-persistence reports `durable: false` there and file opens refuse
loudly, while everything else works unchanged. The shim
prefers `instantiateStreaming` (which requires the `application/wasm` MIME type) and falls
back to a buffered instantiate on hosts that serve wasm as something else, so a plain
directory listing on a minimal server still boots. Every asset reference in the dist is
**relative** (`day.css`, `./shim.js`, `app.wasm`, `assets/…`), so it serves correctly from a
subpath (a project-Pages URL like `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`) with no `<base>` tag.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

The [`daybrite/actions`](https://github.com/daybrite/actions) companion repo's reusable
`dayapp` workflow can also publish the web-dom build to the calling repo's own Pages site
(e.g. Day-Skies → `https://day-skies.github.io/Day-Skies/`): set `deploy-web: true` with `web-dom`
among the `targets`, so the one workflow that builds and packages every platform also deploys the
web build. Add this to the app repo and enable Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions":

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: ci
on:
  push: { branches: ["**"], tags: ["v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*"] }
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:            # reusable workflows run with the CALLER's permissions
  contents: write       # release-asset upload on tag builds
  pages: write          # web-dom → GitHub Pages
  id-token: write       # actions/deploy-pages authenticates the upload with an OIDC token
jobs:
  app:
    uses: daybrite/actions/.github/workflows/dayapp.yml@main   # pin @<tag> to match your day dep
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      targets: macos-appkit, ios-uikit, android-mdc, web-dom
      deploy-web: true    # publish the web-dom build to GitHub Pages
```

The web deploy reuses the release-profile dist the build already produced (no second build) and
hands it to `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`. No secrets are needed; the
deploy authenticates with the workflow's own OIDC token, which is why `id-token: write` is
required. By default it publishes on every push to the default branch; pass
`web-deploy-tag-pattern: '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'` to publish only on version tags instead.

Beyond static files, the dev server answers two dynamic paths: `/dayscript` (the WebSocket
bridge above) and **`/day-http-ok`**, a method-echo endpoint for HTTP demos whose native
form would spin a loopback listener, which a browser tab cannot (GET answers `day-http-ok`;
any other method echoes `day-http-ok:<METHOD>`, matching the showcase's native one-shot
server byte for byte). On a static host that endpoint does not exist, so the showcase's demo
buttons report what the host returned (a 404 page, or a 405 for PATCH); the URL checker
and every other HTTP call work anywhere.

The showcase publishes its own web-dom build at
**`https://showcase.daybrite.dev/webapp/`**, from the `daybrite/Day-Showcase` repository's CI
rather than from this one, because the app is a separate project; daybrite.dev links to it. This
repository's `web-dom` job still builds the dist and drives the walkthrough against it, as the wasm
build test; it just does not publish the result. To see a local build, `day build --platform web-dom`
in a showcase checkout and serve `build/day/cargo/web-dom/*/dist/`, or `day launch -p web-dom`.

Query parameters the host page reads: `theme=light|dark` (else the OS preference),
`locale=<bcp47>` (else the browser languages), and any app key looked up through `day::env`.
A browser sandbox has no process environment, so `day launch --env K=V` forwards each pair
as `?K=V` (percent-encoded) and `day::env("K")` reads it back through the shim. The shim's
page-fact keys (`vw`, `vh`, `dpr`, `dark`, `locales`, `route`, `tz`, `tzoffset`) and the reserved
`theme`, `locale`, and `dayscript` names shadow same-named app keys; avoid those as env names.
`tz` carries the browser's IANA zone for zone-aware apps such as Day-Time, and `tzoffset` the
offset that zone is running at in MINUTES EAST of UTC — `tzoffset` for now, `tzoffset:<epoch-ms>`
for a moment, since daylight saving makes the answer a function of the instant. Both honor `?tz=`
for testing, so a run can be pinned to a zone the machine is not in. Together they are what lets a
web app compute a local calendar day without shipping a copy of the IANA database: the browser
already has one, and Day-News's "Today" reads it through `daynews-time`.
