## 1. What ships

**`Color` is one struct**, in `day-geometry`:

```rust
pub struct Color { pub r: f64, pub g: f64, pub b: f64, pub a: f64 }   // sRGB, 0.0–1.0, Copy
```

Constructors cover the models an app authors in (`rgb` / `rgba` / `hex(0xRRGGBB)` / `hsl` /
`hsla` / `hsv` / `hsva`), and all of them land in the same four sRGB components. `to_hsl` and
`to_hsv` decompose back; `lerp_hsl` blends along the short hue arc, where a straight line through
RGB would pass through gray. `with_alpha`, `to_hex_string` and `parse` were added with the color
picker: `parse` reads `#rgb` / `#rgba` / `#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa` and the space-separated
component form that `Display` writes, which is what a native pick crosses a JNI / C-ABI / JS
boundary as.

**`Paint` is the fill source**, in `day-spec`:

```rust
pub enum Paint { Solid(Color), Linear(LinearGradient), Radial(RadialGradient) }
```

Gradient geometry is in [`UnitPoint`]s — fractions of the filled shape's bounding box — so one
paint value works at any size. Both gradients replay through each backend's own native gradient
(`NSGradient`, `CGGradient`, a cairo pattern, `QLinearGradient`/`QRadialGradient`, a XAML brush,
an ArkUI gradient, a CSS gradient): all eight canvas backends draw them.

## 2. Where each one is accepted

The two are not interchangeable, and `Paint` is accepted in far fewer places than `Color`.

**`Paint` is accepted by exactly two functions**, both on the canvas: `Draw::fill` and
`Draw::stroke_styled`.

**Everything else takes a bare `Color`:**

| surface | API |
|---|---|
| a piece's background fill | `Decorate::background` |
| a cover's edge-to-edge ground | `Cover::background` |
| a vector glyph's tint | `Vector::tint` |
| a button's fill | `Button::tint` |
| a label's text color | `Label::color`, `TextBuilder::colored` |
| canvas text | `TextStyle::color` |
| a plain canvas stroke | `Draw::stroke` |
| a standalone shape piece | `ShapePiece::fill` / `::stroke` |
| a nav row's icon and badge | `NavItem::icon_tint` / `::badge_tint` |

So a gradient is expressible on a canvas and nowhere else. An app that wants a gradient card
draws one on a canvas and lays its content over it in a `zstack`, which works but gives up the
native container, its corner radius, and its clipping.

Semantic colors are a separate question. There is no `theme::` token module, because default
appearance is native by construction: text, controls, separators and window grounds take the
platform's dynamic colors inside each backend, and a form card takes
`SurfaceRole::SectionCard`. Apps state only the colors they choose.

Those grounds come in PAIRS, and a backend has to take both halves of one. iOS is the clearest
case: `systemGroupedBackground` behind and `secondarySystemGroupedBackground` for the cards that
sit on it — the pairing every Settings-shaped screen uses, and the one that makes a split's two
columns read as one surface rather than two white sheets meeting at a seam. day-uikit paints a
navigation page with the first and `SectionCard` with the second (2026-09). It used to pair the
plain ground with a translucent `tertiarySystemFill` card; changing either alone leaves grey on
grey or a card that cannot be seen. DESIGN.md
[§6.3](../DESIGN.md#63-semantic-theme-tokens) records that decision and why it has held.

## 3. What a native color picker can hand back

The picker prompted this document, so this section lists what each chooser produces.

| chooser | value type | models the user can author in | alpha | beyond sRGB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NSColorPanel` (macOS) | `NSColor`, in **any** color space | grayscale, RGB, CMYK, HSB, color lists, image spectrum, crayons | opt-in | yes — Display P3 and any installed ICC profile; also **pattern** colors (an image) and **named catalog** colors |
| `UIColorPickerViewController` (iOS) | `UIColor` | grid, spectrum, RGB/HSB sliders, hex | opt-in | yes — Display P3 on wide-gamut devices |
| `GtkColorDialog` | `GdkRGBA` (f32) | the GTK editor's HSV plane + hex | opt-in | no — sRGB |
| `QColorDialog` | `QColor` (Rgb / Hsv / Hsl / Cmyk / ExtendedRgb specs) | basic + custom palettes, HSV picker, eyedropper | opt-in | ExtendedRgb allows out-of-range components |
| XAML `ColorPicker` | `Windows.UI.Color` (8-bit ARGB) | spectrum, channel sliders, hex | opt-in | no — sRGB |
| `<input type="color">` | `#rrggbb` string | the browser's own UI | new `alpha` attribute, still shipping | new `colorspace="display-p3"` attribute, still shipping |

There are four things in that table that `Color` cannot carry. Opacity is not one of them;
`Color` has had an alpha channel from the start, and the picker binds it directly.

1. **The color space.** A Display P3 red is outside sRGB. Converting it in clamps it to something
   the user did not pick, and nothing downstream can tell that happened. This gap widens as
   wide-gamut displays become the default on every Apple device and common elsewhere.
2. **The authoring model.** HSB → RGB → HSB is not the identity. Hue is undefined at zero
   saturation and at zero brightness, so a value the user reached by dragging brightness to the
   floor comes back as "black, hue 0" and the picker re-opens on red. Every real picker keeps H/S/V
   as its own state to avoid this ([day-piece-colorpicker](colorpicker.md)'s composed panel does
   exactly that, per presentation), but the *bound value* still cannot express it, so the state
   dies when the panel closes.
3. **Dynamic system colors.** `NSColor.controlAccentColor`, `?attr/colorPrimary`, the XAML accent
   brushes: these are rules the OS re-evaluates on a theme change, an accent-color change, or an
   increase-contrast setting, rather than fixed values. Flattening one into four floats freezes
   it at the moment it was read. Today an app cannot bind to one at all, which is the gap
   DESIGN.md §6.3 leaves open.
4. **Pattern and named-catalog colors** (AppKit only). An image is not a color and will never fit
   in this type. They are out of scope below, and the color picker's AppKit arm drops such a pick
   rather than reporting a wrong value.

Gradients come up here too. No color picker on any platform returns a gradient; the gradient gap
is in §2, where the surfaces that take a color do not take a `Paint`.

## 4. Proposal

> [!WARNING]
> Everything below is a proposal. It is not implemented, and `day-piece-colorpicker` binds to
> today's `Color`.

There are five changes, ordered by what they pay off. Each is independently landable, and only
the fourth is a wide edit.

### 4.1 `Color` becomes a value or a role, and stays `Copy`

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct Color {
    pub value: ColorValue,
    /// Multiplies whatever `value` resolves to. Outside the value so `.opacity(0.14)` works on a
    /// role as well as on a literal — which is most of what an app does with alpha.
    pub alpha: f64,
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ColorValue {
    /// Literal components in a stated model and space. Round-trips exactly.
    Components { space: ColorSpace, model: ColorModel, c: [f64; 4] },
    /// A platform semantic role the BACKEND resolves when it paints, so it tracks light/dark, the
    /// user's accent color, and increase-contrast instead of freezing at build time.
    Role(ColorRole),
}

pub enum ColorSpace { Srgb, DisplayP3, Rec2020 }
pub enum ColorModel { Rgb, Hsl, Hsb, Cmyk, Gray, OkLch }
pub enum ColorRole {
    Accent, Label, SecondaryLabel, PlaceholderLabel, Separator,
    WindowBackground, ControlBackground, SelectedContent, Link, Destructive,
}
```

The shape is chosen for three properties.

- **It stays `Copy` and fixed-size.** `[f64; 4]` holds CMYK's four channels and leaves the fourth
  slot unused for the three-channel models; `ColorRole` is fieldless. Props structs across
  day-spec are `Copy`, and a `Vec` in `Color` would take that away from all of them.
- **Every existing constructor survives unchanged.** `Color::hex(0xE86A3C)` builds
  `Components { space: Srgb, model: Rgb, c: [.91, .42, .24, 0.] }` with `alpha: 1.0`;
  `Color::hsv(30., .8, .9)` builds the same struct with `model: Hsb` and keeps the hue the user
  chose. Gap 2 closes by construction; a picker's HSB pick survives being stored.
- **The picker's result needs no separate type.** `Color` already says which model and which space
  it came from, so a pick is a `Color`, and re-opening the chooser can land the user back in the
  tab they were in.

The accessor every backend and most app code uses:

```rust
impl Color {
    /// sRGB components, always available — what a backend paints when it has nothing better, and
    /// what every `c.r` / `c.g` / `c.b` / `c.a` site becomes. A `Role` resolves through a
    /// documented off-platform fallback table (the backend is what really resolves one).
    pub fn srgb(&self) -> [f64; 4];
}
```

This change breaks field access. `c.r` / `c.g` / `c.b` / `c.a` appear in roughly 90 places
across the day crates and a handful in each app; each becomes `srgb()` destructuring or
`with_alpha`. That is the entire migration, and it is mechanical.

### 4.2 The toolkit SPI resolves a role instead of receiving four floats

Backends stop taking components and start taking a `Color`, resolving it themselves:

| role | AppKit / UIKit | GTK | Qt | XAML | Android | web |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Accent` | `controlAccentColor` / `tintColor` | `@accent_color` | `QPalette::Highlight` | `AccentFillColorDefaultBrush` | `?attr/colorPrimary` | `AccentColor` |
| `Label` | `labelColor` | `@theme_fg_color` | `QPalette::WindowText` | `TextFillColorPrimary` | `?attr/colorOnSurface` | `canvastext` |
| `Separator` | `separatorColor` | `@borders` | `QPalette::Mid` | `DividerStrokeColorDefault` | `?attr/colorOutlineVariant` | `-webkit-…` |

A role is re-resolved on the appearance change every backend already reports, so a bound role
repaints with the system. This change closes gap 3, in the shape DESIGN.md §6.3 left room for: a
typed value rather than an app-side token module, which is the part of that decision to keep.

### 4.3 A wider space rides along instead of clamping

`ColorSpace` on the value lets a Display P3 pick reach a backend that can honor it (`CGColor`
with a P3 space, `android.graphics.Color.valueOf(r, g, b, a, ColorSpace)`, CSS
`color(display-p3 …)`, `QColor::fromRgbF` with extended range) and lets everyone else convert
down once, at the edge, where the loss is visible in one place instead of at authoring time.
`Color::srgb()` is that conversion.

`Cap::WideGamut` reports whether the compiled backend honors a non-sRGB space, so an app that
cares can check.

### 4.4 `Paint` becomes the currency for surfaces, but not for marks

Promote `Paint` from canvas-only to the type every *surface* takes, with
`impl From<Color> for Paint` so existing call sites compile unchanged:

```rust
fn background<M>(self, paint: impl IntoReactive<Paint, M>) -> Decorated<Self>;  // Decorate
fn background(self, f: impl Fn(&R) -> Paint + 'static) -> Self;           // Cover
pub fn fill<M>(self, paint: impl IntoReactive<Paint, M>) -> Self;         // ShapePiece
```

The marks keep `Color`: `Vector::tint`, `Button::tint`, `NavItem::icon_tint` / `badge_tint`,
`Label::color`, `TextRun::colored`, `TextStyle::color`. A template tint and a text color are solid
by nature on every toolkit Day targets; making them accept a gradient and then documenting "the
gradient is ignored here" is worse than the restriction being in the type. A surface takes a
`Paint`, and a mark takes a `Color`.

Backends that cannot paint a gradient behind a native container answer
`Cap::GradientSurface = Unsupported` and paint the gradient's midpoint sample, so a page degrades
to a flat card rather than to nothing.

`Paint` also gains a conic shape and an interpolation choice while it is being touched:

```rust
pub enum Paint { Solid(Color), Linear(LinearGradient), Radial(RadialGradient), Conic(ConicGradient) }

pub struct GradientStops {
    pub stops: Vec<(f64, Color)>,
    /// The space stops are interpolated IN. sRGB is the historical default and the muddy one;
    /// Oklab is perceptually even, and `Hsl` sweeps the hue arc — which `Color::lerp_hsl` already
    /// does by hand for the animation path, so the framework has taken this position once already.
    pub interpolate: Interpolation,
}

pub enum Interpolation { Srgb, Oklab, HslShorter, HslLonger }
```

`Conic` is the one gradient shape every backend can draw (`QConicalGradient`, `CAConicGradient`,
a cairo mesh, `conic-gradient()`) and the one a color wheel wants.

### 4.5 Serialize the whole type the way CSS Color 4 does

`Display` and `parse` grow to cover the whole type rather than sRGB components:

```
#e86a3c            #e86a3c80          srgb(0.91 0.42 0.24)
display-p3(1 0 0 / 0.5)               hsb(30 0.8 0.9)
cmyk(0 0.55 0.75 0.09)                oklch(0.7 0.15 40)
role(accent)                          role(label / 0.6)
```

The grammar is CSS Color 4's: a reviewed design for this problem, one web developers already
read, and a pass-through for the web arm. dayscript's `input:` step types the same grammar,
`day-lite` parses it, and it crosses every native boundary, so there is one grammar instead of
four.

## 5. What this proposal does not do

- **Patterns and image fills.** An `NSColor` pattern is an image; it belongs in an image API. The
  color picker drops such a pick.
- **ICC profiles or arbitrary color management.** Three named spaces cover what the platforms
  actually expose; a general CMM is a different project.
- **A theme token module.** §6.3's decision stands: roles are typed values on `Color` rather than
  an app-side `theme::` namespace, and the default is still to state nothing and get the
  platform's colors.
- **Making `Color` non-`Copy`.** Every shape above is chosen to preserve it.

## 6. Which change to land first

§4.4, `Paint` for surfaces, goes first. It is the gap an app hits first (there is no way to put
a gradient behind anything but a canvas), it is additive rather than breaking, and it needs no
change to the `Color` type at all.

§4.1 and §4.2 have to land together, because a role in the type means nothing until backends
resolve it. That is the larger change, and the one [day-piece-colorpicker](colorpicker.md) would
benefit from most: a picker that could offer the platform's accent color as a preset, and have
the pick stay dynamic, is a different control from one that hands back four frozen floats.
