# Native `list` (§10)

`list` drives the platform's recycling list (`NSTableView` / `UITableView` /
`RecyclerView` / `GtkListView` / `QListView`), so large collections get native
virtualization, scroll physics, and platform behaviors. It is the one place Day's
build-once model meets cell reuse, and the resolution is the same model: a row subtree is
built once per physical cell and *rebound* (a single slot-write into its `ItemSlot`) every
time that cell is recycled for a new item.

Contrast with [`each`](../crates/day-pieces): `each` builds every row eagerly under one
anchor (fine for a dozen items; ten thousand would all be built up front). `list` builds only
the rows the native widget currently shows.

## API: row sources, shared with `each`

`list(source, row)` and `each(source, row)` take a **`RowSource`** (where the rows come from)
and one row builder. Two sources ship:

**Plain data**: an items closure and a key function, wrapped in `items(…)`:

```rust
list(items(move || messages.get(), |m| m.id), move |row: ItemSlot<Message, u64>| {
    column((
        label(move || row.field(|m| m.sender.clone())),
        label(move || row.field(|m| m.preview.clone())),
    ))
})
.row_height(RowHeight::Uniform(56.0))   // ::Automatic currently sizes rows at a fixed default
.on_select(move |key| open(key))
.id("inbox")
```

The row builder receives an `ItemSlot<T, K>` (Copy handle, tracked `get()`, memoised `field()`
projections). Because cells are recycled, the builder must read through the slot rather than
move the item in, so a surviving cell can be fed a new `&T` with one write.

**A day-model store** (feature `model`; [docs/model.md](model.md)): passed directly for collection order,
or through `store.rows(projection)` for a display order/filter expressed as a tracked key
projection:

```rust
list(store.rows(model::ordered_keys), |slot: ModelSlot<Item>| {
    row((
        label(move || slot.name().read()),   // wakes only for THIS row's name
        toggle(slot.done()),                 // two-way; follows the cell across recycles
    ))
})
.on_select(|it: Elem<Item>| open(it.key()))
```

`ModelSlot` is itself a day-model `Source`, so the derive's field accessors hang off it and
resolve the current row on every operation; a control bound once at build keeps working as
the cell recycles. The costs stay local: a field edit patches the one control showing it (the
row set is unchanged, so the native reload is skipped and nothing is cloned); a change the
projection reads re-runs only the projection; and a cell scrolled
across the whole collection leaves no observation claims behind
(`day-pieces/tests/model_rows.rs` measures all three).

Builder options: `.row_height(RowHeight)`, `.on_select(Fn(Ref))` (the key for a plain source,
the row's `Elem` for a store source), `.multi_select(bool)`, `.on_selection(Fn(Vec<Ref>))`,
`.selected_rows(Fn() -> Vec<usize>)`, and (reserved, unshipped) `.row_kind` mapping to native
reuse pools.

### Imperative scroll-to-end (chat timelines)

A chat timeline wants to stick to the newest message. Two additive builder options drive the
native list's own scroller (not a Day-side scroll view):

```rust
let follow = day_reactive::Trigger::new();
list(items(move || messages.get(), |m| m.id), row_builder)
    .scroll_to_end(follow)   // each `follow.notify()` scrolls so the last row is fully visible
    .stick_to_bottom(true)   // convenience: auto-scroll to end after every data reload
// … after appending a message:
follow.notify();
```

- `.scroll_to_end(Trigger)`: a `watch` on the trigger applies a new `ListPatch::ScrollToEnd`, which
  each backend maps to its native "make the last row visible" call
  (`NSTableView::scrollRowToVisible` · `UITableView::scrollToRowAtIndexPath(.bottom)` ·
  `GtkScrolledWindow` vadjustment→max · `QScrollArea` scrollbar→max ·
  `ListView::smoothScrollToPosition` · XAML `ScrollViewer::ChangeView`). day-core guards the
  empty-list case (no patch is sent), and building the list never auto-scrolls.
- `.stick_to_bottom(bool)`: best-effort convenience that scrolls to the end after each data reload.
  It does not check whether the user is already near the bottom (no cross-backend scroll-position
  read exists yet); for that finer behavior drive `scroll_to_end` from your own logic instead.

## `ListSource`: how the backend pulls rows

Recycling lists *pull*: the native data-source asks, synchronously, "how many rows?" and "fill
this cell for row N". Day's normal native→Day path is enqueue-only (`EventSink`), so `list` adds
a second, synchronous channel, `ListSource`, injected into the backend the same way the event
sink is:

```rust
// day-spec
pub struct ListSource {
    pub len: Rc<dyn Fn() -> usize>,
    pub token_at: Rc<dyn Fn(usize) -> u64>,     // stable per-row identity for the native widget
    pub bind_row: Rc<dyn Fn(usize, RawHandle)>, // build-or-rebind row `i` into this native cell
    pub recycle: Rc<dyn Fn(RawHandle)>,         // cell leaving the viewport: its ids park until the next bind
    pub layout_cell: Rc<dyn Fn(RawHandle, f64)>, // re-lay that cell's row at the width the platform gave it
}

trait Toolkit {
    // default no-op; a recycling backend stores the source and calls it from its data-source.
    fn attach_list(&mut self, _host: &Self::Handle, _source: ListSource) {}
}
```

day-core builds the `ListSource` when it realizes a `LIST` node; each closure re-enters the tree
via `with_tree(...)`. The backend calls them on the UI thread from *outside* any `with_tree`
borrow (a fresh native scroll callback), so the re-entry is safe.

`bind_row` is the sanctioned exception to turn-batching (§3.3): it runs the row's reactive flush
and layout before returning, because the host measures the cell synchronously right after.

## The driver (day-core)

Per `LIST` node the tree holds:

- a **row factory** supplied by the `list()` piece (type-erased over `T`): given a row index and a
  cell-anchor `RNode`, it builds the row subtree and returns its `Scope` + root + slot-writer;
- a **snapshot** of the current items + their tokens, refreshed by an effect on the items closure;
- a **cell map**: `RawHandle → BoundRow { anchor, scope, root, slot_writer, token }`.

`list_bind_row(host, index, cell)`:
1. adopt `cell` into a cell-anchor `RNode` (a boundary node whose handle *is* the native cell,
   the same trick the window root uses);
2. if the cell is new, run the row factory (build once); otherwise rebind: one slot-write of
   `items[index]` into the existing row's signal, and update its token;
3. `flush_now` the row scope + lay the row out within the cell bounds, synchronously.

When the items signal changes, the effect refreshes the snapshot and applies a `ListPatch::Reload`
so the native widget re-queries the source. (Fine-grained insert/remove/move batching over the
keyed diff, like `each`'s, is a reserved refinement; `Reload` is the v1 behavior.)

## Per-backend mapping

| Backend | Widget | Recycling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| mock    | simulated viewport | yes (test-driven) | `MockProbe::scroll_list(range)` drives binds; exercises the driver |
| AppKit  | `NSTableView` (view-based) | native | `makeView`/`viewFor` → `bind_row`; `numberOfRows` → `len` |
| UIKit   | `UITableView` + reuse id | native | `cellForRowAt` → `bind_row` |
| Android | `RecyclerView` + `Adapter` | native | `onBindViewHolder` → `bind_row` |
| GTK 4   | `GtkListView` + `GtkListItemFactory`; each cell a `DayCell`, a custom container that asks for no width and lays the row out at the width the themed `row` node grants it | native | factory `bind`/`unbind` → `bind_row`/`recycle`; the cell's `size_allocate` → `layout_cell` |
| Qt      | `QListWidget` + one item per row, Day's cell attached with `setIndexWidget` as it scrolls in | none — cells stay pinned to their row (Cap reports `Emulated`, DP-19) | the view owns selection, keys, focus, drag; Day owns the rows |

## Building it (mock-first, like M0–M1)

1. **spec**: `kinds::LIST`, `ListProps { row_height, selectable, multi_select }`, `RowHeight`, `ListPatch`,
   `ListSource`, `Toolkit::attach_list`. *(additive; no backend breaks)*
2. **pieces**: `list()` + builder, reusing `ItemSlot`; produces the type-erased row factory.
3. **core**: the driver + cell-anchor adoption + `list_bind_row`/`list_len`/reload.
4. **mock**: a simulated viewport + `MockProbe` hooks; e2e tests: only-visible-rows built,
   recycle = slot-write (no rebuild), data change → reload rebinds, `on_select`.
5. **backends**: AppKit first (reference), then UIKit/Android/GTK/Qt; showcase `list` playground +
   walkthrough leg on all five.

## Selection

Rows report selection through two events: `Event::SelectionChanged(row)` (single) and, in
multi-select mode, `Event::SelectionSet(rows)`, the full set of selected indices on every
change. `.on_selection(Fn(Vec<K>))` receives the selected keys either way (a single-selection
report arrives as a one-element set), so an app tracking the whole selection works on every
toolkit. `.selected_rows(Fn() -> Vec<usize>)` reactively syncs app state back into the native
selection (`ListPatch::Selected`; empty clears) without a selection-event echo; drive it from
the same signal `on_selection` writes to get a two-way binding and a "clear selection" action.

Support matrix: **AppKit** (native `NSTableView` multi-selection), **Qt**, **XAML** and
**web-dom** (the emulated lists: a per-cell press hook, a highlight treatment on the cell's
background, ctrl/cmd toggles, shift extends) honor `multi_select` and `ListPatch::Selected`.
**Android** and **ArkUI** report single selection (a tap replaces, the touch idiom) but do
honor `ListPatch::Selected`: the sync paints the visible cells (the theme accent at 20%
alpha as the cell background) and newly bound cells inherit their row's state, which is what
lets the composed tree's selection follow the canvas ([docs/tree.md](tree.md)). The remaining
toolkits report single selection (`SelectionChanged`) and ignore the multi flag and the
programmatic sync; the one-element `on_selection` contract still holds there.

### Keyboard

A selectable list is a tab stop, and the arrow keys walk it: ↑/↓ move one row, Home and End jump
to the first and last, and the row that lands is scrolled into view by the edge it left, so a
held arrow scrolls a line at a time rather than recentering on every step. On a `multi_select`
list, shift moves the far end of a range while the near end stays put, so `shift+↓ ↓ ↑` grows
twice and shrinks once instead of restarting from wherever the last press ended. A press reports
exactly what a click on the same row reports, so `on_select`/`on_selection` need no keyboard case.

On the desktops this is the native widget's own behavior: nothing in Day sits ahead of the
responder chain, so a focused table, outline or `QListWidget` gets its arrow keys the way it
always would ([docs/menus.md](menus.md)). Qt earns it since 2026-09, when its list became a real
`QListWidget` hosting Day's cells as index widgets; before that it was a scroll area of Day's own,
and an arrow scrolled it. On **web-dom** there is no native list to inherit it from, so the
backend builds it: the host carries `role="listbox"` and the tab stop, cells carry `role="option"`
and `aria-selected`, and the shim routes the keys into `day_dom_list_key`. Focus sits on the host
rather than a row, because rows are recycled as the list scrolls and focus parked on one would
evaporate under it.

## Programmatic scrolling

`.scroll_to_end(Trigger)` follows the last row (above); `.scroll_to_row(Signal<Option<usize>>)`
jumps to any row: set the signal to `Some(row)` and the native list scrolls it into view,
realizing it if it was virtualized away (`ListPatch::ScrollToRow`, clamped to the count). The
signal is the row rail's counterpart to `scroll(...).scroll_target(...)`. Backends without a native
scroll-to-index (GTK ≤ 4.10, Qt, XAML, web) position by uniform row pitch; prefer
`RowHeight::Uniform` when jumping programmatically there.

A Reload whose rows are the same set in a new order (a shuffle, a programmatic sort) animates
as native row moves on AppKit (`moveRowAtIndex` batch, the same animation a drag commit gets);
other backends apply it instantly. Inserts, removals, and content changes always reload flat.

## Drag-to-reorder

```rust
list(source, row)
    .reorderable(true)
    .on_reorder(|from, to| { /* rotate the backing Vec + persist */ })
    .reorder_guard(|from, to| Reorder::Allow)   // optional: Deny / Retarget(i)
```

`reorderable` turns on the platform's drag mechanism; probe `Cap::ListReorder` for support.
`on_reorder` is the commit: row `from` landed at row `to`; apply the identical rotation to the
backing data (`let it = v.remove(from); v.insert(to, it);`) and persist it if the order should
survive a relaunch. It runs at the next event drain, never inside the native drop callback.

`reorder_guard` vets every proposed drop **synchronously, while the drag is live**: the native
affordance (the macOS gap, the no-drop cursor) reflects the answer before the user releases.
`Deny` refuses the drop (the row springs back); `Retarget(i)` accepts it at a different index,
the "pinned rows" pattern (the Showcase pins its first row this way). Keep the guard pure: it
runs inside the platform's drag callback, so read state and return without mutating UI.

The reorder half of `ListSource` (`ListSource::reorder`, present only when `.reorderable()`)
has two calls: `can_move(from, proposed) -> accepted-index-or--1` for the live verdict, and
`move_row(from, to)` for the commit, which rotates Day's row snapshot **before returning**, so
`len`/`token_at`/`bind_row` answer in the new order while the native move animates, and defers
the app's `on_reorder` through the event queue. When the app's own data change echoes back with
exactly the committed token order, the piece skips the redundant `Reload` (no post-drop flicker).

The dayscript step `reorder: { id, from, to }` drives the same guard → commit path without a
native gesture (a guard denial fails the step, non-retryably); that is how CI asserts reordering
on every target.

Per-backend affordances:

| Backend | Mechanism | Affordance | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppKit | `NSTableView` drag pipeline (pasteboard row, `validateDrop`/`acceptDrop`) | the `.gap` placeholder opens where the drop would land | live (validate retargets/denies) |
| UIKit | drag delegate + `moveRow`/`targetIndexPathForMove` | long-press lift + gap, no editing mode | live (target-for-move) |
| Android | `ItemTouchHelper` on the RecyclerView | long-press lift, elevation, incremental swaps | live per swap; `Retarget` reads as deny (the helper can't relocate the gap) |
| GTK 4 | `DragSource`/`DropTarget` (native DnD framework) | row snapshot as drag icon; forbidden cursor on deny (no insertion line yet) | live (motion) |
| Qt | `QDrag` over the emulated list | grabbed-cell pixmap, 2px insertion line, no-drop cursor | live (drag-move) |
| XAML | WinRT `CanDrag`/`DragOver`/`Drop` over the emulated list | system drag visuals + live no-drop cursor | live (DragOver) |
| ArkUI | `SetNodeDraggable` + `NODE_ON_DROP` | system drag preview; denied drops spring back | at drop (`SetDragResult`) |
| web-dom | pointer-tracked (emulated — no native list reorder in the browser) | lifted cell + animated CSS gap, long-press on touch | live (every hovered slot) |
| mock | `MockProbe::list_can_move` / `list_move` | op log | live |

## Swipe-to-delete

```rust
list(source, row)
    .deletable(true)
    .delete_label(res::str::delete().format())   // optional: the word on the affordance
    .on_delete(|index| { /* remove from the backing Vec + persist */ })
    .delete_guard(|index| index != 0)            // optional: protect individual rows
```

`deletable` turns on the platform's delete gesture; probe `Cap::ListDelete` for support.
`on_delete` is the commit: row `index` is gone; apply the identical removal to the backing data
(`v.remove(index)`) and persist it if the change should survive a relaunch. It runs at the next
event drain, never inside the native swipe callback.

`delete_guard` is consulted **before the affordance is offered**, not after the gesture: a row
that answers `false` shows no delete action at all, rather than one that fails on use. Keep it
pure; it runs inside the platform's swipe callback.

`delete_label` carries the app's own word for the action, already localized. A toolkit has no
access to the app's Fluent catalog and so cannot translate anything itself; left unset, each
backend falls back to its platform's wordless idiom (a trash glyph), which needs no
translation.

The delete half of `ListSource` (`ListSource::delete`, present only when `.deletable()`) has
two calls: `can_delete(index) -> bool` for the offer, and `delete_row(index)` for the commit,
which drops the row from Day's snapshot **before returning**, so `len`/`token_at`/`bind_row`
answer for the shorter list while the native removal animates, and defers the app's
`on_delete` through the event queue; the reorder half follows the same rule.

**The desktop toolkits answer `Unsupported`** for the delete affordance: GTK, Qt and XAML have
no swipe idiom at all, and macOS's row actions (the swipe-actions section below rides them) do
not carry the delete affordance yet. A list that must be editable everywhere pairs
`.deletable()` with an explicit control (a menu item, a per-row button) and lets the mobile
toolkits add the gesture on top.

The dayscript step `delete_row: { id, row }` drives the same guard → commit path without a
native gesture (a guard refusal fails the step, non-retryably), which is how CI asserts deletion
on every target, including the desktops, where there is no gesture to simulate.

| Backend | Mechanism | Affordance |
|---|---|---|
| UIKit | `trailingSwipeActionsConfigurationForRowAtIndexPath` | row tracks the finger, destructive action reveals behind it, full swipe commits |
| Android | `ItemTouchHelper` swipe (`START`, so it is the trailing edge in RTL too) | row slides to reveal a red field carrying the label; `notifyItemRemoved` animates the close-up |
| AppKit · GTK · Qt · XAML · web | — | `Unsupported`: the delete affordance does not ride macOS's row actions yet, and the rest have no swipe idiom; use a menu item or a row button |
| ArkUI | `NODE_LIST_ITEM_SWIPE_ACTION` | *not yet implemented* — the NDK exposes it; the shim does not build it yet |

## Swipe actions

Swipe actions generalize swipe-to-delete: app-declared buttons reveal behind a row as the
user drags it aside, on either edge, with the platform's full-swipe shortcut for the first
one (Mail's triage gestures).

```rust
list(source, row)
    .swipe_trailing(move |i| {
        let read = is_read(i);
        vec![
            swipe_action(if read { str::mark_unread() } else { str::mark_read() }.format())
                .symbol(if read { Symbol::CircleFilled } else { Symbol::Circle })
                .tint(palette().accent)
                .action(move || set_read(i, !read)),
        ]
    })
    .swipe_leading(move |i| vec![
        swipe_action(str::delete_word().format())
            .destructive(true)
            .action(move || remove(i)),
    ])
```

The provider runs at **gesture time**, with the row index, as the row starts to slide, so the
offer reflects the row's current state (the "Mark as Read" / "Mark as Unread" flip above is
why it is a closure rather than a fixed list). Keep it pure and fast: it runs inside the
platform's swipe callback. The `action` handlers run later, at the event drain, never inside
the native gesture. When an activation drains, the provider is invoked again and the action
looked up by position, so the handler always closes over the row's current state.

`symbol` puts a glyph on the button where the platform draws one: above the label on macOS
(Mail's row-action look), in place of it on iOS (the label stays the accessibility name). The
platforms without a glyph slot show the label alone.

Edges are semantic, not geometric: `Leading` follows the reading direction (left in LTR, right
in RTL), exactly as every platform's swipe API already spells it. A full swipe across
activates the edge's first action. `destructive` takes the platform's destructive styling
(red, on the Apple toolkits); `tint` colors the button where the platform honors one.

Probe `Cap::ListSwipeActions`: **Native** on macOS (`NSTableView`'s
`tableView:rowActionsForRow:edge:`, the two-finger Mail swipe) and iOS
(`UISwipeActionsConfiguration`, sharing one pipeline with swipe-to-delete: on the trailing
edge a `.deletable()` list offers its delete action first, then the row's own trailing offer).
Everywhere else the answer is `Unsupported` and no affordance is drawn, so pair each action
with an explicit control (a menu item, a toolbar button) for the rest, as the delete section
advises.

`ListSource::swipe`, present only when an edge is declared, carries the swipe half:
`actions_at(index, edge) -> Vec<ListSwipeAction>` pulls the offer (label and styling; the
handlers stay in the pieces layer), and `perform(index, edge, action)` commits an
activation, deferring the app's handler through the event queue.

The dayscript step `swipe_row: { id, row, edge?, action?, label?|key? }` drives the same
offer → commit path without a native gesture (`edge` defaults to `trailing`, `action` to 0,
the full-swipe button). `label:` (literal) or `key:` (a Fluent key resolved in the run's
locale) pins which button the step may press; pinning matters because offers are
state-dependent. The pin is checked before the press: a mismatched offer refuses the
activation and fails the step, leaving the row's state untouched, so a stale pin (say, from
an aborted earlier run's leftover state) fails once instead of flipping state and poisoning
every later run. An empty offer or an out-of-range action also fails, non-retryably. This is
how a walkthrough exercises the wiring on every target, including the toolkits that show no
affordance.

## Separators

```rust
list(source, row).separators(true)
```

The host draws row separators, at the row boundary; row content does not. A hand-drawn
hairline inside a row sits wherever the row's own layout puts it, which is not where the
native selection ends and not where the platform slides its rows: it misaligns with the
selection under a uniform pitch, doubles up with iOS's native line, and stays frozen while a
swipe-action reveal slides the row past it. The host's separator sits at the boundary, so
none of those apply.

Left unset, each platform keeps its own default: iOS draws separators, the desktops don't.
`.separators(true)` forces them on, `.separators(false)` off (an iOS list whose rows draw
their own separation turns the native line off rather than showing both).

| Backend | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| AppKit | `gridStyleMask = solidHorizontalGridLineMask`, `separatorColor` |
| UIKit | the table's own `separatorStyle` (default on; `false` sets `.none`) |
| GTK | a `border-bottom` on the ListView's `row` CSS nodes |
| web | a `border-bottom` inside each cell frame (border-box) |
| Qt · Android · XAML · ArkUI | *not lowered yet* — a force is ignored; rows separate by their pitch |

## Reorder + row-height caveat

Rows drag within their own list only; nothing is draggable out of the app. `RowHeight::Automatic`
lists compute the drop slot from a uniform-pitch approximation on GTK/Qt/XAML/ArkUI; prefer
`Uniform` heights for reorderable lists there.
