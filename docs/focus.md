# Focus

> **Status: implemented** on every backend (AppKit, UIKit, GTK, Qt, Android, XAML, ArkUI, and

Day apps need two things from focus: to know when a control gains or loses it, and to move it.
Both are declarative (one reactive signal per form stands in for focus-node objects and view
references), and both ride the machinery Day already has: the event sink, origin-tagged writes,
and per-node Toolkit duties.

## 1. The API

Focus binds to a signal with `.focused(…)`, exactly like every other two-way control binding.
One name covers both shapes (a marker-trait overload, the `IntoText` pattern):

```rust
// One field: a Bool signal. Native focus writes it; writing it moves focus.
let editing = Signal::new(false);
text_field(query).focused(editing)

// A form: one Option<K> signal for the whole group (the recommended shape).
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Field { User, Pass }
let focus = Signal::new(Some(Field::User));
column((
    text_field(user)
        .on_submit(move || focus.set(Some(Field::Pass)))
        .focused((focus, Field::User)),
    text_field(pass).focused((focus, Field::Pass)),
    button("Log in").action(move || {
        if user.with(|s| s.is_empty()) { focus.set(Some(Field::User)); return; }
        …
    }),
))
```

- **Native → signal:** when the control gains focus the signal becomes `true` / `Some(K)`; when
  it loses focus, `false` / `None`, unless another bound control gained it in the same turn, in
  which case the group signal moves straight to that control's value (no `None` in between).
- **Signal → native:** writing `Some(K)` / `true` requests native focus for the bound control.
  Writing `None` / `false` resigns it; on iOS and Android that dismisses the soft keyboard,
  matching the platform convention SwiftUI set.
- **Reading is free.** `focus.get() == Some(Field::User)` is a tracked read like any other,
  with nothing else to wire.
- **Field chaining** is a write in `on_submit(f)`, which ships with the same change: the native
  end-editing / return hooks focus needs are the ones `Event::Submitted` needs.

`.focusable()` opts a composed container into focus: the canvas contract (press-to-focus,
`FocusChanged` both ways, the keys through `.on_key` while focused) behind the
`Toolkit::set_focusable` duty. Implemented on macos-appkit (2026-08, the content-list keyboard
work in [docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)); on every other backend the duty is a no-op
today, so the piece renders normally and never joins the key loop, the same silence
unfocusable controls have. Reserved with names but not implemented: `default_focus(…)`
on containers, `focus_order(n)`, and focus scopes for dialogs. Tab/Shift-Tab traversal stays
native. Day wraps real widgets, so platform traversal is already correct (§13: focus order
follows layout order).

## 2. Semantics: the rules

1. **Writes are requests.** A write asks the toolkit on the next main-loop turn; the last write
   in a turn wins.
2. **The signal converges on reality.** Backends report the *resulting* state through
   `Event::FocusChanged`, and that report is what lands in the signal (through the echo guard).
   A request naming a target the platform will not focus produces no event: platform focus is
   unchanged, and the next real focus event corrects the signal.
3. **One-turn latency.** `focus.set(…)` then `focus.get()` in the same turn reads the old
   value, the same asynchrony every reference framework has, made explicit.
4. **Mount reconciliation.** When a piece bound to `K::V` mounts and the signal already reads
   `Some(K::V)`, it requests focus. Set the signal, then present the sheet: the field focuses
   when it appears. (The initial `false`/`None` is *not* applied: resigning focus a control
   never had would steal it from whoever has it.)
5. **Echo discipline.** A programmatic focus move fires native focus events; those must not
   re-request. The pieces layer keeps a per-binding echo cell of the native state and skips
   applies that already match it; backends additionally skip resigns when the control doesn't
   own focus (so a stale release can't blur a sibling).
6. **Loss and gain pair up.** When focus moves between two controls bound to the same group
   signal, the event pump dispatches the queued gain *before* the loss it arrived with, so the
   signal transitions `Some(A)` → `Some(B)` without an observable `None`. A loss with no queued
   successor (click on empty space, window resigned) writes `false` / `None`.

## 3. How it rides the existing machinery

| layer | what shipped |
|---|---|
| day-spec | `Event::FocusChanged(bool)` became real. New defaulted duty: `fn focus(&mut self, h: &Handle, node: NodeId, focused: bool) {}` — the `scroll_to`/`enable_gesture` shape. |
| day-core | `TreeOps::focus_node` (clones the handle, calls the duty), `NodeProbe.focused` (mirrored from `FocusChanged` for dayscript), gain-before-loss pairing in the pump, `enqueue_events` batch enqueue. |
| day-pieces | `Decorate::focused(…)` with `IntoFocusBinding` markers for `Signal<bool>` and `(Signal<Option<K>>, K)`; the echo cell; `on_submit(f)` on `text_field`. |
| day-mock | `focus #N true/false` op log + `MockWidget.focused` — the F1 test contract. The mock duty does **not** synthesize `FocusChanged` back; tests emit events explicitly. |
| day-script | `focus: { id, focused? }` drives the real duty (keyboards and end-editing flows engage) and `assert_focused: { id, focused? }` reads `NodeProbe.focused` (retryable — focus lands a turn after the request). |

## 4. Per-toolkit implementation

"Observe" is gain/loss detection, "drive" is the request/resign duty.

| backend | observe | drive |
|---|---|---|
| AppKit | text fields: `DayTextField` overrides `becomeFirstResponder` (gain); `controlTextDidEndEditing:` on the `DayTarget` delegate (loss — except `NSTextMovementReturn`, which is `Submitted`: AppKit keeps the field first responder on return). Non-text controls drive but don't observe in v1. | `makeFirstResponder(view)` / `(None)`. The resign guard unwraps the shared **field editor** back to its delegate field before deciding ownership. |
| UIKit | `EditingDidBegin` / `EditingDidEnd` targets on the text field; `EditingDidEndOnExit` is `Submitted` (registering it is also what makes Return dismiss the keyboard). | `becomeFirstResponder()` / `resignFirstResponder()` — focus **is** the keyboard on iOS. Buttons are not first-responder focusable. |
| GTK 4 | `EventControllerFocus` (`enter`/`leave`) on entry, button, switch, and scale — it tracks focus-within, which covers `GtkEntry`'s inner `GtkText`. `Entry::activate` is `Submitted`. | `grab_focus()`, retried once at `map` if the widget isn't mapped yet (rule 4); resign via `root.set_focus(None)`, only while the widget holds focus-within. |
| Qt 6 | `day_qt_enable_focus` — a `FocusIn`/`FocusOut` event filter (the `DayGestureFilter` pattern) on line edit, button, checkbox, and slider; popup-reason focus-outs are ignored (menus are transient). `returnPressed` is `Submitted`. | `setFocus(Qt::OtherFocusReason)` / `clearFocus()` (only while focused). Qt delivers focus events only in the *active* window, so the duty activates it first — via the OS when allowed, else app-locally (`QApplication::setActiveWindow`, kept by Qt for exactly this driving/embedding case). |
| Android | `View.OnFocusChangeListener` on the inner `TextInputEditText` → event kind 16; `OnEditorActionListener` (IME action or hardware enter key-down) → `Submitted` (kind 17). | `DayBridge.focusView`: `requestFocus()` + `InputMethodManager.showSoftInput` on gain; on resign, hide the IME and `clearFocus()` — which lands on `DayActivity`'s focusable-in-touch-mode root instead of snapping to the first focusable field. |
| XAML | `GotFocus`/`LostFocus` per control (system XAML has no global focus event) on button, toggle, slider, and text box; `KeyDown` Enter in a `TextBox` is `Submitted`. | `Control.Focus(FocusState::Programmatic)` (draws no focus visual); resign parks focus on an invisible 1×1 `ContentControl` sink (`IsTabStop` flipped around the call, so it never sits in the tab order). |
| ArkUI | `NODE_ON_FOCUS` / `NODE_ON_BLUR` registered on button, text input, toggle, and slider; `NODE_TEXT_INPUT_ON_SUBMIT` is `Submitted`. | `OH_ArkUI_FocusRequest(node)` (typed non-focusable errors ignored — rule 2); resign via `OH_ArkUI_FocusClear(OH_ArkUI_GetContextByNode(node))`, guarded by `NODE_FOCUS_STATUS`. |
| mock | logged op + `MockWidget.focused` | logged op |

**Which controls are focusable.** Text fields are focusable everywhere. On desktop, buttons,
toggles, and sliders are too, with the platform's keyboard-access rules (macOS buttons
join the key loop only with Full Keyboard Access on, and AppKit v1 doesn't observe them; Qt
button focus policy is style-dependent). On touch mobile, non-text controls generally are not
focusable, and the bindings stay quiet there.

**A `canvas` is focusable on every toolkit**, and observes both ways. It is the
one built-in piece with no native control underneath, so nothing would otherwise make it the
focused element, and without that, keys could never reach what an app draws.
`Decorate::on_key` is built on this ([docs/menus.md](menus.md)): keys follow focus, so a canvas
that has it hears the arrows and a text field that takes it gets them back.

| backend | focusable | takes focus on press |
|---|---|---|
| AppKit | `acceptsFirstResponder` | `mouseDown:`, before forwarding to the gesture recognizers |
| UIKit | `canBecomeFirstResponder` | `touchesBegan:`, likewise |
| GTK 4 | `set_focusable` | a `GestureClick` that calls `grab_focus` |
| Qt 6 | `Qt::StrongFocus` | the focus policy itself (click or tab) |
| web-dom | a `tabindex` | a `pointerdown` listener |
| XAML | `Control::IsTabStop` on a `ContentControl` host wrapped around the `Canvas` — in system XAML `IsTabStop` and `Focus` are Control members (they moved up to `UIElement` only in WinUI 3), and a Panel is not a Control | `PointerPressed` on the host, which the press reaches by bubbling out of the Canvas; the Panel also takes a transparent `Background`, because an unpainted one is not hit-testable |
| ArkUI | the `NODE_FOCUSABLE` attribute | ArkUI's own focus handling |
| Android | `setFocusableInTouchMode`, without which `requestFocus` refuses it during touch input | `dispatchTouchEvent`, before the gesture listener, and only for a canvas the app hung `.on_key` on: in touch mode a focus move can dismiss a raised soft keyboard |

Each reports `FocusChanged` both ways (`becomeFirstResponder`/`resignFirstResponder`,
`focus`/`blur`, `GotFocus`/`LostFocus`, `NODE_ON_FOCUS`/`NODE_ON_BLUR`, `onFocusChanged`), so `.focused(signal)`
binds two-way and `assert_focused` can see it.

**A view that is not in a window cannot hold the keyboard**, and Day does not work around
that. On iOS a full-screen modal takes the presenting view out of the window, so a canvas
behind a compact inspector sheet ([docs/inspector.md](inspector.md)) refuses focus until the
sheet closes; the request lapses and the signal snaps back, which is rule 2.

## 5. Testing it

- **Unit (mock):** two-way Bool binding, group moves without a `None` blip, mount-time
  `Some(K)` requests focus, `on_submit` fires (`day-pieces/tests/mock_e2e.rs`).
- **dayscript:** the showcase walkthrough's Focus block runs `focus` / `assert_focused` against
  the real duty on every scripted platform (macOS AppKit/GTK/Qt, iOS, Android: 208/208), with
  assertions kept to text fields, the one control focusable everywhere.
- **Showcase:** the Focus page (`Day-Showcase/src/pages/focus.rs`) demonstrates the group
  signal steering a form (with Return chaining), the plain Bool binding, and non-text-control
  focus with a live readout.

## 6. Prior art: what Day adopted and rejected

- **SwiftUI** (`@FocusState`, `.focused(_:equals:)`). Adopted: the Bool + Optional-of-Hashable
  binding shape, `nil` clears focus and dismisses the keyboard, moved focus writes back on loss.
  Rejected: the unconstructible binding (state can't live outside the view); Day signals have
  no such restriction.
- **Flutter** (`FocusNode`/`FocusScope`). Rejected as an API (imperative node lifecycle inside a
  declarative tree); adopted as semantics: "focus changes apply after the build phase" is
  rule 3, and the scope-restore behavior informs the reserved focus-scope design.
- **floem** (the nearest cousin): its `request_focus(when)` showed that signal-driven focus
  writes work; its event-only *reads* are the asymmetry rule 2 closes.
- **iced / egui / Slint / GPUI**: converge on last-write-wins, next-frame application, and
  focus-nowhere being representable, all reflected in the rules.

## 7. Resolved design questions

1. **Group-signal loss semantics** — solved in the pump: a `FocusChanged(false)` scans the
   queue for a paired `FocusChanged(true)` from another node and dispatches the gain first, so
   group signals never blip through `None` (rule 6).
2. **Resign target on Android/XAML** — both resign to a focusable root: Android to the
   activity's focusable-in-touch-mode content root, XAML to a hidden focus-sink control.
3. **`focused_eq` naming** — one `.focused()` name via two marker-trait impls; the tuple form
   `(signal, key)` replaces a second method.
4. **Headless CI focus** — programmatic `grab_focus`/`setFocus` is window-local on every
   backend (Qt after the app-local activation above), so scripted runs don't depend on the
   window manager granting real OS focus.

## 8. Keyboard avoidance (the keyboard never covers the focused field)

Each mobile backend consumes the soft keyboard natively and resizes the Day root through the
`WindowResized` event (the same relayout path a rotation takes), so the whole UI shrinks to the
visible area and the focused field is scrolled back into view:

- **Android**: the root's wrapper folds `WindowInsetsCompat.Type.ime()` into the bottom margin
  (alongside the system-bar insets), so a raised keyboard shrinks the root exactly like a taller
  navigation bar would. The resize flows to Day (`DayFixed.onSizeChanged` → `WindowResized`),
  Day relayouts, and the platform `ScrollView` then applies its stock resized-with-focus
  behavior, scrolling the focused descendant back into view.
- **iOS**: the app delegate observes `UIKeyboardWillChangeFrame`, clamps the root view's bottom
  to the keyboard's top, emits `WindowResized`, and after Day's relayout reveals the focused
  `UITextField` via `scrollRectToVisible` on its nearest enclosing `UIScrollView`. Show, hide,
  and height changes (emoji pane, hardware-keyboard toggles) all ride the one notification.
- **HarmonyOS**: the window's UIContext is set to `KeyboardAvoidMode.RESIZE`, so ArkUI shrinks
  the page instead of translating it; the host page's `onAreaChange` forwards the new area
  through the `resized()` NAPI export, and Day relayouts into it.

Desktop backends have no soft keyboard, so nothing engages. Avoidance needs no per-app opt-in;
every Day app gets it. The related programmatic primitive is `TreeOps::scroll_reveal`
([docs/scroll.md](scroll.md)), which scrolls any element's nearest scroll ancestor into view.
