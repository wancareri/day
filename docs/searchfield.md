# Search field (external piece)

> **Status: implemented** as `day-piece-searchfield`, an external Day Piece (like `day-piece-combobox`)
> registered link-time into each backend's renderer slice without touching day. One API: a native
> search input, bound two-way to a `Signal<String>`, realized as each toolkit's dedicated search control.

## Authoring

```rust
use day_piece_searchfield::search_field;

let query = Signal::new(String::new());
search_field(query).placeholder("Search fruit…").id("search")
```

`search_field(query)` takes a `Signal<String>` bound two-way: every native edit writes the text back
to the signal, and setting the signal (e.g. a Clear button doing `query.set(String::new())`) patches the
control. `.placeholder(impl IntoText)` sets the empty-state prompt; it accepts a constant,
`Signal<String>`, or closure, read once for the initial value (the placeholder is fixed at build).
`SearchField` implements `Piece`, so `.id()`/`.a11y()`/`.frame()` chain via `Decorate`. Like day-core's
`text_field` it is a **width-growing leaf** (`grow_w = true`, natural single-line height): a search
field fills its row, so constrain it with `.frame(w, h)` if you need a fixed width.

The signal is a controlled input (§4.4): a per-build **echo guard** remembers the last value that
arrived from the native control so `bind_seeded` does not patch that same value straight back (which
some toolkits would re-emit as a change, causing a feedback loop). The programmatic-sync side is additionally
guarded per backend (see the table).

## Per-backend native realization

| AppKit | UIKit | GTK | Qt | Android | XAML |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NSSearchField` | `UISearchTextField` (iOS 13+) | `GtkSearchEntry` | `QLineEdit` search shim (clear button + leading magnifier) | `EditText` (single-line, `IME_ACTION_SEARCH`) | `AutoSuggestBox` (query magnifier) |

Each control reports edits through `Event::TextChanged(String)`, the same event a built-in text
field emits, so `dayscript`'s `input:` step drives the piece on every backend without touching native
code. The change plumbing per backend:

- **AppKit**: a per-node delegate implements `NSControlTextEditingDelegate::controlTextDidChange:`.
  Programmatic `setStringValue` does not fire that delegate, so no suppression is needed (update only
  writes when the value actually differs).
- **UIKit**: a per-node target on `UIControlEvents::EditingChanged`. Programmatic `setText` does not
  fire `EditingChanged`, so no suppression is needed.
- **GTK**: `GtkSearchEntry::"search-changed"`. That signal *does* fire on programmatic `set_text`, so a
  per-node `suppress` cell guards the sync in `update`.
- **Qt / XAML**: each carries its own C++ shim inside this crate (`src/lib-qt-shim.cpp`,
  `src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp`), compiled by the crate's `build.rs`. The Qt shim wraps a `QLineEdit`
  (`setClearButtonEnabled(true)` + a leading `edit-find` action) and wraps programmatic `setText` in
  `blockSignals`. The XAML shim boxes its `AutoSuggestBox` into a Day handle through the
  `day_xaml_box` / `day_xaml_unbox` functions that `day-xaml-sys` exports, the same mechanism the
  picker/media XAML shims use, so a piece never touches day-xaml's private handle wrapper.
- **Android**: carries its own Java factory
  (`platform/android/java/dev/daybrite/day/piece/searchfield/DaySearch.java`), folded into the app's Gradle build
  automatically via `[package.metadata.day.android]`, with no edits to day-android (see
  [docs/extending.md](extending.md)). A `TextWatcher` calls `DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, 1, …)`
  (kind 1 = `TextChanged`); the programmatic setter guards on equality (a plain `EditText`, so no Gradle
  dependency or manifest permission).

## Verification

The showcase **Controls** page (`controls.rs` `search_section`) binds a `search_field` to a `query` signal that filters a
small fruit list (Apple, Banana, Cherry, Date, Elderberry) case-insensitively. Each match is a
`when`-gated label in a column, and a `#search-result` label shows the first match. A **Clear** button
sets the signal to `""` to prove the reverse binding patches the native field. The walkthrough navigates
to `search`, types `"ch"` into `#search-input`, asserts `#search-result` reads `Cherry` (the two-way
binding round-tripping the signal), taps `#search-clear`, and screenshots. Rust is clippy-clean
(`-D warnings`) and `cargo fmt`-clean for every backend feature; host-verified for AppKit/GTK/Qt/mock,
cross-compiled for iOS-sim (`uikit`) and Android (`mdc`).

## Follow-ups

- Reactive placeholder (currently fixed at build).
- A submit rail (`Event::Submitted` on the search-action key / return) for "search on enter" semantics.
- Disabled/enabled state; scoped-search tokens (macOS `NSSearchField` recent-searches menu).

XAML is CI-only (built under `cfg(windows)` + the Windows SDK); it isn't buildable on the macOS/Linux
dev hosts.
