# Menus (§ menus)

Day renders menus with each toolkit's native menu machinery: `NSMenu`, `GtkPopoverMenu` /
`GtkPopoverMenuBar`, `QMenu` / `QMenuBar`, `UIMenu` (via `UIContextMenuInteraction`), Android
`PopupMenu` / the app-bar overflow, and XAML `MenuFlyout` / `MenuBar`. There are two surfaces:

- **Context menus**: per-Piece, shown on secondary-click (desktop) or long-press (touch), attached
  with the [`Decorate::context_menu`] modifier.
- **The app menu**: the global menu bar on desktop, installed once with [`app_menu`].

Both are described with the same small, toolkit-neutral tree of [`MenuEntry`] values. Day owns the
model; the backend owns the rendering, so a menu looks and behaves like any other native menu on
the host platform without the app making any per-platform assumptions.

## Building a menu

```rust
use day_pieces::*;

label("Right-click me")
    .context_menu(vec![
        menu_item("Rename").action(|| rename()),
        menu_item("Duplicate").key("d").action(|| duplicate()),   // ⌘D / Ctrl+D
        menu_separator(),
        sub_menu("Move to", vec![                                  // nested submenu
            menu_item("Inbox").action(|| move_to(Inbox)),
            menu_item("Archive").action(|| move_to(Archive)),
        ]),
        menu_separator(),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Copy),                                 // standard Edit ▸ Copy
        menu_item("Delete").shortcut(Shortcut::plain("Delete")).action(|| delete()),
    ])
```

The pieces, all in the `day_pieces` prelude:

| Builder | Produces |
|---|---|
| `menu_item(label)` | A clickable command. Chain `.action(f)`, `.key("s")`, `.shortcut(_)`, `.enabled(bool)`. |
| `sub_menu(label, vec![…])` | A nested submenu (arbitrarily deep on desktop; see platform notes). |
| `menu_separator()` | A divider between groups. |
| `menu_role(role)` | A standard system command; see [Standard roles](#standard-roles). |

## Icons

An item can carry the platform's own glyph beside its title:

```rust
menu_item(tr("rectangle")).icon(Symbol::Rectangle).action(place_rect)
menu_item(tr("brand")).image("brand-mark").action(insert_brand)
```

`.icon(Symbol)` takes the same standard vocabulary toolbars take (each backend draws its own
glyph: an SF Symbol, a freedesktop icon name, a Segoe Fluent code point), and `.image(name)` a
bundled picture from `resource/images` for something only this app has.

An icon is always an addition to a menu that reads correctly without one, because not every
platform's menus carry pictures:

| | icons in menus |
|---|---|
| **AppKit**, **UIKit** | yes — `NSMenuItem.image` / `UIAction` image, from the shared SF Symbol table |
| **GTK** | yes — the `GMenuModel` "icon" attribute, drawn by `GtkPopoverMenu` |
| **Qt** | yes — `QAction::setIcon`, resolved like a toolbar icon (theme name, then Day's own outline, then the QStyle standard set) |
| **XAML** | symbols only — a `FontIcon` from the Segoe Fluent table; a bundled image would need the toolbar's three-field icon channel |
| **Android** | ignored: Material's overflow menu is text-only, and an icon belongs on an app-bar action |
| **ArkUI**, **web-dom** | no menus of this kind to put an icon in |

## Keyboard shortcuts

A [`Shortcut`] is a key plus modifiers. `primary` is the platform's command modifier (⌘ on Apple,
Ctrl elsewhere), so one spec is correct everywhere:

```rust
menu_item("Save").key("s")                       // ⌘S / Ctrl+S   (primary + key, the common case)
menu_item("Save As…").shortcut(Shortcut::new("s").shift())   // ⇧⌘S / Ctrl+Shift+S
menu_item("Delete").shortcut(Shortcut::plain("Delete"))      // no primary modifier
```

`Shortcut::new(key)` sets `primary`; `Shortcut::plain(key)` sets no modifiers; `.shift()`, `.alt()`,
`.control()` add the others (`.control()` is the physical Control key, distinct from `primary` on
macOS). Named keys (`"Return"`, `"Delete"`, `"Space"`, `"F5"`, arrows) are recognized alongside
single characters. The shortcut is drawn in the native accelerator position and is live whenever the
menu (or its window) is in the responder/focus chain. On GTK, `primary` spells the Command key on
macOS (`<Meta>`, since GTK4's `<Primary>` is a plain `<Control>` alias, unlike GTK3's) and `<Primary>`
elsewhere, so the one spec stays right on macos-gtk too.

The standard roles need no spelling at all: `menu_role(Undo/Redo/Cut/Copy/Paste/SelectAll)` items
take the platform-neutral defaults (primary+Z/X/C/V/A, shift for redo) unless the app sets its
own. AppKit's native items always carried these; the lowering gives GTK, Qt, and the other
action-routed backends the same accelerators.

Shortcuts render on the platforms that draw a menu bar: the three desktops, which is
[`Cap::AppMenu`](duty-matrix.md). The UIKit and Android menu builders take the item and drop
its accelerator, so an app that wants a key to work there routes it through `.on_key` on the
focused piece instead; probe `Cap::AppMenu` to decide which, or the key fires twice where both
apply. Day-Sketch's `canvas_key` is the worked example.

## Standard roles

`menu_role(MenuRole::…)` emits the platform's built-in command rather than a custom action, so the
familiar items keep their native label, default shortcut, automatic enable/disable, and their
focus targeting: Edit ▸ Copy copies from whatever control has focus, with no wiring:

```rust
app_menu(vec![
    sub_menu("Edit", vec![
        menu_role(MenuRole::Undo), menu_role(MenuRole::Redo),
        menu_separator(),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Cut), menu_role(MenuRole::Copy),
        menu_role(MenuRole::Paste), menu_role(MenuRole::SelectAll),
    ]),
])
```

| Role | AppKit | GTK | Qt | UIKit | Android | XAML |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cut/Copy/Paste | `cut:`/`copy:`/`paste:` selectors — a focused text view answers first, then the app's edit bridge⁴ | `clipboard.*` actions | dispatched to the focused `QLineEdit`/`QTextEdit` | responder chain, then the edit bridge⁴ | edit bridge⁴ (text keeps its own selection toolbar¹) | accelerator² |
| SelectAll | `selectAll:` selector — a focused text view answers first, then the edit bridge⁴ | `selection.select-all` | focused editor | responder chain, then the edit bridge⁴ | edit bridge⁴ | accelerator² |
| Undo/Redo | `undo:`/`redo:` (responder chain — the acting `NSUndoManager`, a focused text field's before the document's) | stock actions (`text.undo`) | focused editor | installed undo bridge³ | installed undo bridge³ | — |
| Quit / Close / Minimize / Fullscreen | standard App-menu items | window actions | window / `qApp` | — | — | Quit closes the window |
| About / Preferences | moved into the App menu | — | `menuRole` → app menu (mac) | — | — | — |

You can override a role's label (`menu_role(r)` starts empty and the backend fills the standard label;
supply your own via `MenuEntry::role` on a `menu_item` if you want a custom title). Roles with no native
equivalent on a platform render as an inert labeled item; no behavior is imposed.

³ On a toolkit with no native undo responder, `MenuRole::Undo`/`Redo` items lower onto a
standing dispatcher (`day_core::undo_action_id`) that invokes the undo history installed via
`day::install_undo` ([docs/model.md](model.md)), the same stack the platform's own route reaches on
macOS/iOS, so one `menu_role` pair behaves consistently everywhere the menu renders.

⁴ The edit bridge (`Cap::EditBridge`). An app that can cut/copy/paste its own objects installs
handlers once:

```rust
day::install_edit_commands(
    || !selection().get().is_empty(),   // can_copy — a tracked read
    copy_selection,                     // -> Option<String>: the serialized payload
    cut_selection,                      // -> Option<String>, and removes the objects
    |text| paste_payload(text),         // whatever text the clipboard held
    select_all,                         // Edit ▸ Select All (⌘A/Ctrl+A)
);
```

`copy`/`cut` place their payload on the system clipboard, and Paste asks for it back — but the
answer is not guaranteed. Android grants clipboard READS only to the app holding input focus
([clipboard.md](clipboard.md)), and its own copy overlay can take that focus for a moment, so a
Paste seconds after a Copy can be handed nothing. Day keeps what the app last placed there and
pastes that when the platform comes back empty, which is what makes an app's own Cut/Copy ▸ Paste
work on every target; a clip from another app is still what the platform answers with, and it
always wins.

Two companions round out the platform's input idioms. `day::modifiers()` answers the keyboard
modifiers held right now (`shift`, `primary`, which is ⌘ on Apple platforms and Ctrl elsewhere,
and `alt`), for interactions whose meaning they change: shift-click adding to a selection instead
of replacing it. It is a live query, not an event field, so it is right wherever it is asked. A
backend that cannot answer reports all-false, which is correct for touch platforms and something
to check before relying on it elsewhere ([the `modifiers` row of the duty
matrix](duty-matrix.md)). A dayscript `tap:` or `drag:` step's declared `modifiers:` take
precedence while it dispatches.

`.on_key(f)` handles the non-text keys, under the web `KeyboardEvent.key` names and with the
held modifiers on the event (`ev.shift()` scales a nudge from 1px to 10). The four arrows
arrive everywhere. `Delete` and `Backspace` arrive only where [`Cap::AppMenu`](duty-matrix.md)
is unsupported, where there is no menu bar and so no accelerator that could own them.

That split keeps one key to one owner. **A focused piece
that claims a key stops any accelerator from ever seeing it**: the platform offers the key to
the focus chain, and a piece with an `.on_key` handler claims every key the route carries, not
just the ones its handler acts on. So a canvas that received `Delete` on a menu-bar platform
would swallow the very `Delete` its own Edit menu was about to act on. Route a key through the
menu or through `.on_key`, never both, and probe `Cap::AppMenu` to decide which. Day-Sketch's
`canvas_key` is the worked example, and the delete keys are routed to match it.

The two delete keys keep the names the platform gives the physical key, so a handler meaning
"remove this" takes both: a Mac's ⌫ reports `Backspace`, a full-size keyboard's Del reports
`Delete`. **Keys follow focus.** The handler hangs off a piece and fires only while that piece is the focused
one, so it is scoped the way every other input is:

```rust
canvas(draw)
    .on_key(nudge_selection_by)     // only while the canvas has the keyboard
    .focused(canvas_focused)        // …which it takes at mount and on every press
```

That scoping is why there is no window-level key handler to pair it with. A global route cannot
tell a nudge the app wants from the keys a focused widget needs: it has to run ahead of the
platform's own dispatch, which means guessing whether the first
responder would have wanted the key, and every guess is wrong for something. Day-Sketch's
arrow-nudge used to be installed that way, and it took the arrow keys away from every list and
sidebar in every app that had one. Hanging the handler on the canvas removes the question:
AppKit's responder chain and the DOM's focus already answer it.

The cost is that a piece must be able to hold focus for its keys to arrive
([docs/focus.md](focus.md)). A `canvas` can on every toolkit but android-mdc (each backend
makes its drawing surface a tab stop and reports focus both ways), which makes it the piece a
drawing app hangs its keys on. A piece that cannot take focus on a given backend never
hears a key there, and a canvas nobody gave a handler to keeps none of them: an unclaimed
arrow keeps walking, so an enclosing scroll view still scrolls and the platform's own focus
navigation still moves between controls.

The payload format is the app's own; Day-Sketch uses a standalone SVG document, so shapes
paste into anything that reads SVG and SVG from other editors pastes back. day places the
payload on the system clipboard (day-part-clipboard) and reads it back for paste; on web-dom
the browser's `copy`/`cut`/`paste` events themselves are the route, with the event's
`clipboardData` as transport. Precedence is the platform's own: on macOS/iOS the responder
chain lets a focused text field keep its clipboard behavior, and the app's handlers see only
what falls through, with the same items, shortcuts, and menu validation
(`can_copy` greys Cut/Copy; Paste additionally requires clipboard text). On toolkits whose
role items come back as plain menu actions (Android's app bar, web context menus), the
`menu_role(Cut/Copy/Paste)` items dispatch to the same handlers via standing ids.

¹ Android editable views raise the system selection toolbar for Cut/Copy/Paste; a role in a Day menu is
shown for parity and dispatches nothing.
² XAML carries the standard accelerator; the focused `TextBox` handles the keystroke itself.

## The app menu

```rust
app_menu(vec![
    sub_menu("File", vec![
        menu_item("New").key("n").action(|| …),
        menu_item("Open…").key("o").action(|| …),
        menu_separator(),
        menu_item("Save").key("s").action(|| …),
        menu_role(MenuRole::CloseWindow),
    ]),
    sub_menu("Edit", vec![ /* roles, as above */ ]),
])
```

Top-level entries are the menu-bar menus. Call `app_menu` at startup or any time the menu changes; it
replaces the previous app menu.

### Claiming a standard slot

Each desktop fills the standard menu-bar slots it knows (Edit, View, Help) with its own stock menu
for any slot the app did not claim, so an app never restates the platform's furniture. **Tag your own
version with `.bar_role(...)` to take a slot:**

```rust
sub_menu("View", vec![ /* … */ ]).bar_role(MenuBarRole::View)
```

A tagged menu replaces the stock one *in place*, so it also lands where the platform expects that
menu to sit: `File`, `Edit`, `View` in the bar's leading order rather than adrift after them.

The tag identifies the slot, not the title, because of localization: day's catalog and your
app's may translate the same menu differently (day's `day-view` is *Présentation*; the showcase's is
*Affichage*), so a bar matched on titles would show both under `--locale fr`. An untagged submenu
whose title *does* equal the slot's standard name still takes the slot (that stops the most common
accidental duplicate), but it is a safety net, not the contract. Tag the menu.

Where each backend puts the bar:

- **AppKit**: the system menu bar. Day prepends the standard **App menu** (About/Quit) automatically,
  so your `sub_menu`s start at *File*.
- **GTK**: a `GtkPopoverMenuBar` at the top of the window; accelerators registered on the
  `GtkApplication`. On macOS the model goes to `gtk_application_set_menubar` instead; GTK's quartz
  backend renders it in the system menu bar, and the stock GTK app menu's *Settings…* item enables
  through an `app.preferences` action wired to the Preferences dispatch id.
- **Qt**: a `QMenuBar` (the native global bar on macOS-qt).
- **Android**: the app-bar overflow (⋮), built by `DayActivity.onCreateOptionsMenu`.
- **XAML**: a `MenuBar` docked at the top of the window.
- **iOS/iPhone**: a no-op, because touch platforms have no persistent global menu bar; the native
  affordances are the per-Piece context menu and the system edit menu. (iPad/Catalyst `UIMenuBuilder`
  wiring is a future addition.)

## How it works

The builder lowers to a flat, toolkit-neutral [`day_spec::MenuItem`] tree. Each item's closure is
registered with day-core, which hands back a process-unique **action id**; only the id travels into the
native menu. When the user chooses an item the backend emits `Event::MenuAction(id)`; the event pump
routes it to `dispatch_menu_action`, which runs the closure inside a reactive batch (so signal writes
made from a menu coalesce into one update, just like a button tap). Standard roles carry no id; they
resolve to the toolkit's own command instead. This keeps the crossing minimal (an integer), avoids
holding native handles across the FFI boundary, and lets any backend add menu support by implementing
just two `Toolkit` methods: `set_app_menu` and `set_context_menu`.

## Re-installing the same menu

`set_app_menu` compares the incoming model with the installed one, ignoring the action ids, because an app
declares its menu inside the page build, so every route change re-installs the same commands behind
freshly registered closures. A menu that differs only in those ids rebinds them onto the ids the
platform already holds and makes no toolkit call, which keeps a menu the user has open from closing
under them and stops the menu bar being rebuilt on every navigation. Anything else (a label, a
shortcut, an enablement, a new command) installs as before.

This is the rule the toolbar follows for the same reason ([docs/toolbars.md](toolbars.md), "Re-installing the same
bar"), where the rebuild also took the keyboard focus out of the search field.

## Nav-row context menus

A selector's rows can each carry their own context menu (`item(…).context_menu(vec![…])`
inside the `.items` mapper, [docs/navigation.md](navigation.md)) for the sidebar idioms every desktop app
grows: per-feed "Mark all read", per-project "Reveal in Finder", the Showcase's per-page
"Show Source". The entries are the same builders as everywhere else and lower through the
same action registry, so a chosen entry dispatches identically to a piece context menu; the
menus re-lower (re-localizing their labels) whenever the rows re-derive, like the
row titles.

Per backend: AppKit serves them through the outline's `menuForEvent:` (NSTableView-family
views consume right-clicks themselves, so a menu attached to a cell's subviews would never
be consulted); UIKit through the table delegate's row-context hook (the standard long-press
row menu); GTK a per-row `PopoverMenu` with secondary-click + long-press gestures; Qt one
`QMenu` per row popped from the list's custom-context request; Android a best-effort
`setNavRowMenus` follow-up after the nav mounts (the same off-critical-path rule as the row
tints, [docs/vectors.md](vectors.md)). Web and ArkUI drop them for now, same as the piece decorator's
matrix.

## Platform notes

- **Nested submenus** are unlimited on the desktop backends and iOS. Android menus support a single
  level of submenu (a platform limit); deeper submenus flatten into the nearest one.
- **Separators** render as dividers everywhere; on Android they become menu-group boundaries (dividers
  on API 28+).
- A `context_menu(vec![])` (empty) or a later reconfigure detaches/replaces the menu on the Piece.

## Future surfaces: dock, taskbar, and launcher menus

The same [`MenuEntry`] tree is the right shape for the app-wide surfaces day does not drive
yet: a macOS Dock menu is the existing builder plus one delegate hook
(`applicationDockMenu(_:)`), while Windows jump lists and `.desktop` Actions persist while
the app is closed, so their dispatch would have to lower to a relaunch argument; that is the
design gap, gated on those platforms' deep-link intake.

Launcher shortcuts already shipped by another road: Day.toml `[[shortcuts]]` drives iOS,
Android, and HarmonyOS as route-keyed saved deep links, and
[docs/deep-links.md](deep-links.md) describes that end to end.

## Runtime language changes: `app_menu_reactive`

`app_menu(vec)` resolves labels once, in the install-time locale. An app whose language can
change at runtime (a preferences language picker, [docs/windows.md](windows.md)) installs with
`app_menu_reactive(builder)` instead: the builder re-runs whenever a locale-tracked read
inside it changes (`menu_role` labels, `res::str` titles, and `day::tr` all read the locale
signal), re-lowering and re-installing the whole bar in the new language. Replacement drops
the previous install's action closures; context menus share the dispatch map and are
untouched, and the durable Preferences/New Window dispatch ids always survive.

## The auto Preferences item + the Window menu

`day::register_preferences*` gives every platform its standard Settings…/Preferences item
(⌘, / Ctrl+comma) without any menu code in the app, and macOS also auto-installs the standard
Window menu. The mechanics (injection into an installed menu, role rewiring, and the
`register_new_window` builder) are described in [docs/windows.md](windows.md).

## Driving menus from dayscript

`menu: { item: "Save" }` invokes a unique app-menu action by exact label;
`menu: { key: menu_save }` resolves a Fluent key in the run's locale first (locale-portable:
app keys and the `day-*` role keys both work, so the auto Preferences item is
`key: day-preferences`, with or without an installed app menu). `path: [File]`
disambiguates by ancestor submenu: each entry matches a submenu's literal label or its
Fluent key resolved in the run's locale, so `path: [menu_file]` works wherever
`key: menu_file` does and one script stays valid in every language. The step dispatches the
registered day action directly (toolkit-uniform, no native menu automation), so role-only
items that run a native selector (Cut, Quit, …) are not invokable this way.

## Dynamic context menus

`.context_menu(items)` is declarative: one menu, set at build time. Some surfaces cannot
know their menu until the click lands (a canvas whose commands describe the selection under
the pointer, a tree whose rows each mean something different), so two summon-time forms
exist ([docs/tree.md](tree.md) is the driving case):

- `.context_menu_fn(|point| … -> Vec<MenuEntry>)` on any piece: the closure runs when the
  user summons the menu (right-click on desktop, long-press on touch), receives the location
  in the piece's own coordinates, and whatever it returns is shown. An empty result shows
  nothing. The closure may adjust app state first (select what is under the pointer, then
  build); it runs on the UI thread, outside any day-core borrow, like every other synchronous
  Toolkit callback.
- `tree(…).row_context_menu(|key| … -> Vec<MenuEntry>)`: the per-row form, handed the row's
  key. By convention, a summon on a row outside the current selection selects that row
  first, so the menu describes what it acts on.

Action closures are lowered per summon into their own scope, disposed when the next summon
(or the piece's teardown) replaces them, so per-click menus never accumulate registrations.

Backends: the duty is `Toolkit::set_context_menu_fn` (default no-op). AppKit serves it from
`menuForEvent:` on the canvas view and the tree's outline; GTK from a button-3 click (and a
long-press) building a one-summon `PopoverMenu`; UIKit from `UIContextMenuInteraction`,
whose configuration callback is already summon-time, and the tree's rows from the
collection view's own `contextMenuConfigurationForItemAtIndexPath`. On AppKit the covered
surfaces are the canvas and tree rows (other views keep the static `.menu` path); GTK's
form is generic over any widget. Qt connects `customContextMenuRequested` to a callback
that asks the provider and pops a fresh `QMenu` per summon (`day_qt_context_menu_fn`),
generic over any widget like GTK's.

### The composed presentation (web-dom)

A toolkit with no native menu to hand the model to reports the summon instead: web-dom's
shim listens for the browser's `contextmenu` (default prevented; **primary-button taps and
drags ignore the right button**, or the summon's own pointer-up would come out as a tap and
re-target the selection under the menu it just built) and emits
`Event::ContextMenu { local, window }`, carrying the point in the node's coordinates for the
app's provider and the same point in window coordinates for placement. The `.context_menu*`
decorators mount a lazily-armed, unrouted cover beside the decorated node (inside an
overlay-host wrapper, so single-child layouts still reach it in the place pass); on the
event they run the same provider and present the lowered model as day pieces at the summon
point, pulled inside the window near edges: item rows (`day-menu-item-N` ids, so a browser
test can click them), separators, inlined submenus, role items resolved to their standing
dispatchers, and disabled items dimmed. A tap outside dismisses. Toolkits that serve
menus natively never emit the event, so the fallback costs them nothing, not even a node,
until a first summon that never comes.

An app whose context menu commands need the clipboard (Cut/Copy/Paste items) calls
`day::invoke_edit(EditOp::…)`, the same handler (transport included) that the platform's own
Edit route reaches, instead of duplicating the clipboard plumbing.
