# Files: native open & save pickers

Day opens and saves files through each platform's native file-interaction UI, using the same
imperative request→response model as [dialogs](./dialogs.md): an action opens a picker and
`.await`s the result:

```rust
button(tr("open")).action(|| day::task(async move {
    if let Some(file) = open_file().filter("Text", &["txt", "md"]).await {
        // `day::task` takes a `Future<Output = ()>`, so handle the error here
        // rather than reaching for `?`.
        match file.read_to_string() {          // FileUrl::read_to_string
            Ok(text) => editor.set(text),
            Err(e) => status.set(format!("error: {e}")),
        }
    }
}));

button(tr("save")).action(|| day::task(async move {
    let saved: Option<FileUrl> = save_file(editor.get_untracked().into_bytes())
        .suggested_name("notes.txt")
        .filter("Text", &["txt"])
        .await;
}));
```

## The path type: `FileUrl`

A file location crosses back as a **`FileUrl`**, a newtype wrapping a single *locator string*.
Each platform hands back a different kind of locator, and the type stores whichever arrives:

- **A string, because of Android:** the Storage Access Framework returns a `content://` URI
  rather than a filesystem path; a `std::path::PathBuf` cannot represent it and `std::fs`
  cannot open it.
- **A newtype, for one parser:** the accessors below live in one place instead of at every
  call site.
- **Stored verbatim:** `url::Url` normalizes and validates in ways that mangle `content://`
  authorities, and it would add a large dependency, so the locator is kept as received.

`FileUrl` is the lossless union (a filesystem path on desktop/iOS, a `content://` URI on Android)
with accessors:

| method | result |
|---|---|
| `as_str()` | the raw locator |
| `local_path() -> Option<PathBuf>` | `Some` for filesystem paths (and `file://`), `None` for `content://` |
| `file_name() -> Option<String>` | the last path component, for display |
| `read() / read_to_string()` | the bytes / UTF-8 text (local paths; `content://` errors) |

**Opened files are always readable.** Where a platform doesn't hand back a usable path, the
backend materializes one first: Android copies the picked document into the app cache, and iOS
imports it into the app sandbox. So `open_file().await?.read_to_string()` works on every
target.

## The builders (`day-pieces`, in the prelude)

- `open_file()` → `OpenFile`: `.title(..)`, `.filter(name, &["ext", …])`, `.await → Option<FileUrl>`.
- `save_file(data)` → `SaveFile`: `.title(..)`, `.suggested_name(..)`, `.filter(..)`,
  `.await → Option<FileUrl>`. The bytes are staged to an app-writable temp file that the backend
  hands to the native save UI; the pieces layer delivers them to a chosen local destination and
  cleans up.

## Per-toolkit native mapping

| Toolkit | Open | Save |
|---|---|---|
| appkit | `NSOpenPanel` (sheet) | `NSSavePanel` (sheet) |
| uikit  | `UIDocumentPickerViewController` (`.import`) | `UIDocumentPickerViewController` (export) |
| gtk    | `GtkFileDialog.open` (GTK 4.10+) | `GtkFileDialog.save` |
| qt     | `QFileDialog` (`ExistingFile`) via the C++ shim | `QFileDialog` (`AnyFile`/`AcceptSave`) |
| android | `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` + `ContentResolver` (copy → cache) | `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` + `ContentResolver` |
| arkui (HarmonyOS) | ArkTS `DocumentViewPicker.select` + `@ohos.file.fs` (copy → cache) | `DocumentViewPicker.save` + `@ohos.file.fs` |
| dom (web) | `<input type=file>` (the browser's picker) | a Blob download |
| mock   | records the spec; resolved programmatically | same |
| xaml  | not yet implemented (like its alert dialogs) | — |

On HarmonyOS the picker lives in the ArkTS `@kit.CoreFileKit` layer, not the native NodeAPI, so
the `day-arkui` backend calls up into its ArkTS host over NAPI (safe: Day's loop runs on the
JS thread); the host drives `DocumentViewPicker` and answers via a registered `onFileResult`
callback, wired in the framework's ArkTS host page (`toolkits/day-arkui/platform/harmony/ets/Index.ets`,
staged into every app's hvigor project by `day build` — [docs/harmonyos.md](harmonyos.md)).

A browser has no filesystem, so on web-dom the bytes ride a per-page store instead of paths:
an opened file's content lands under a virtual `/day-web/<name>` path that `FileUrl::read`
resolves, and a save's staged bytes leave as a download named by `suggested_name`. The app uses
the same builders and the same `FileUrl` surface on web as on every other target.

All backends present the picker non-blocking (sheet / `open()` / delegate / Activity result),
so the main loop keeps running and dayscript stays live while a picker is up.

## Plumbing

Files go through the existing `present` path ([docs/dialogs.md](dialogs.md)) and add no `Toolkit` methods:

- `day_spec::present::PresentSpec::{OpenFile, SaveFile}` + `FileFilter { name, extensions }`.
- `PresentResult::Files(Vec<String>)`: the chosen locators, crossing the C ABI (Qt shim /
  Android JNI) as tag `3` with the paths joined by the unit separator.
- `Cap::FileDialogs` advertises native support.
- `day_spec::present::app_temp_dir()`: the app-writable staging dir; Android sets it to
  `getCacheDir()` (the OS temp dir isn't app-writable there).

## dayscript

A file picker is a presentation, so a script answers it with a path ([docs/dialogs.md](dialogs.md)):

```yaml
- tap: { id: btn-save-file }
- assert_presented: {}
- respond: { path: "notes.txt" }        # relative → the app temp dir (writable on every target)
- tap: { id: btn-open-file }
- assert_presented: {}
- respond: { path: "notes.txt" }         # reads the file just written: a real round-trip
```

This makes open/save flows headless-testable and screenshot-able on every backend without touching
the machine's real filesystem. See `Day-Showcase` (the **Files & storage** page's Files section) and
`Day-Showcase/dayscript/files.yaml`.
