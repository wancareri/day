# Standalone pieces (front-end and backend, no core changes)

A **piece** is a reusable Day widget. Day ships built-in pieces (`button`, `slider`, `list`, …), but
anyone can publish a piece as an independent crate that adds both its cross-platform front-end
(Rust) and its per-toolkit native backend (Objective-C via objc2, C++ shims, Android Java, …),
with no edits to any core Day crate. `day-piece-searchfield` is the reference implementation.

**Scaffold a new piece with `day new`.** Don't hand-assemble the crate: `day new piece <name>`
generates a ready-to-build project (remote Day deps by default; `--local <path>` for a local Day
checkout). With no `--toolkits` it emits a **composite** piece (front-end only); with
`--toolkits appkit,gtk,qt,uikit,mdc,xaml` (any subset) it emits a **native** piece with a renderer
per backend plus the C++/Java/Swift glue each one needs. The companion `day new part <name>` scaffolds
a headless part. For full walkthroughs see the tutorials:
[composite piece](https://daybrite.dev/docs/tutorial-composite-piece/),
[native piece](https://daybrite.dev/docs/tutorial-native-piece/), and
[part](https://daybrite.dev/docs/tutorial-part/).

Extensibility rests on two mechanisms:

1. **Renderers register link-time** into each backend's `RENDERERS` slice (via `linkme`), so a backend
   dispatches an unknown `kind` to the piece's `make`/`update`/`measure` with no registry edits.
   (web-dom is the one exception: `linkme` has no wasm32 implementation, so `day-dom` keeps a
   runtime registry and the piece calls `day_dom::register_renderer` from its own constructor. Same
   three functions, same dispatch, different moment; see [media.md](media.md).)
2. **Native backend assets** (C++ shims, Android Java, Gradle deps) are declared in the crate's own
   `Cargo.toml` / `build.rs` and folded into the app's native build automatically.

## 1. The front-end (any backend)

```rust
use day_core::{BuildCx, Flex, Piece, RNode, with_tree};
use day_reactive::{Signal, bind_seeded};
use day_spec::Event;

pub const KIND: &str = "my.piece.gauge";

pub struct Gauge { /* … + a Signal for two-way binding */ }
impl Piece for Gauge {
    fn build(self, cx: &mut BuildCx) -> RNode {
        let node = cx.leaf(KIND, &props, Flex::default());   // a native leaf of `KIND`
        bind_seeded(seed, move || value.get(), move |v| { with_tree(|t| t.patch(node, patch, false)); });
        cx.on(node, move |ev| { /* native events → write the Signal */ });
        node
    }
}
```

`impl Piece` gives you `.id()`/`.a11y()`/`.frame()` for free (blanket `Decorate`). Props are the full
realize payload; a sparse `Patch` enum carries changes.

Those modifiers return `Decorated<YourPiece>` rather than erasing, so a chain keeps your type. To
make your own builder methods reachable after one, declare them in a `*Builder` trait and forward
it through `Decorated::map_inner`, the pattern every built-in piece follows, written up in
[docs/api-style.md](api-style.md) "Typed builders and erasure":

```rust
pub trait GaugeBuilder: Sized {
    fn ticks(self, n: usize) -> Self;
}
impl GaugeBuilder for Gauge {
    fn ticks(self, n: usize) -> Self { Gauge::ticks(self, n) }
}
impl<Inner: GaugeBuilder + Piece> GaugeBuilder for Decorated<Inner> {
    fn ticks(self, n: usize) -> Self { self.map_inner(|p| p.ticks(n)) }
}
```

Skip any method whose name `Decorate` already defines (`id`, `background`, `scale`, …): the
inherent method on `Decorated` wins resolution, so a forwarded twin would never be called.

## 2. Per-backend renderers: the `renderer!` macro

Each backend module registers its native renderer into that backend's `RENDERERS` slice, the same
slice the built-ins use, so no Day edit is needed. Declare the per-toolkit glue modules with one
line: `day_pieces::glue_modules!(appkit, gtk, qt, uikit, mdc, xaml)` expands to the
feature-and-target-gated `mod` block binding each `lib-<toolkit>.rs` (list only the toolkits you
implement; a non-standard gate, like webview's Linux-only GTK, stays a hand-written block beside
it). Then write typed `make`/`update` (no `&dyn Any`
downcast) and one macro line; `day_pieces::renderer!` expands to the `linkme` registration + the props/
patch downcast:

```rust
#[cfg(all(feature = "appkit", target_os = "macos"))]
mod appkit_impl {
    use super::*;
    fn make(backend: &mut AppKit, props: &MyProps, id: NodeId) -> Retained<NSView> { … }
    fn update(backend: &mut AppKit, h: &Retained<NSView>, patch: &MyPatch) { … }

    day_pieces::renderer!(day_appkit::RENDERERS, AppKit,
        kind: KIND, props: MyProps, patch: MyPatch, make: make, update: update);
}
```

Add `measure: f` for custom sizing: `measure: day_pieces::fill_measure` for a growing leaf (a web
view, a canvas), or omit it for the backend's default. A **patchless** piece (configured once, e.g. Lottie)
drops `patch:`/`update:`: `renderer!(day_uikit::RENDERERS, Uikit, kind: KIND, props: MyProps, make: make)`.
Do the same for `day_gtk::RENDERERS`, `day_qt::RENDERERS`, `day_uikit::RENDERERS`,
`day_android::RENDERERS`, `day_xaml::RENDERERS`. Each backend is behind a cargo feature that pulls in
that toolkit crate; the app enables `my-piece/<backend>` alongside `day/<backend>`.

**Reporting events back.** A renderer calls `day_<backend>::emit(node, event)`. Beyond the fixed
`Event` variants, a piece defines its own event with `Event::custom("my:tag", text)` (in-process); its
`cx.on` reads it. Across a native boundary (JNI/C-ABI) the tag can't be a `&'static str`, so it's empty
and the payload rides in `num`/`text`: on Android the shim calls `DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, 12, num,
text)` (kind 12 = the open Custom channel). `day-piece-webview` reports its URL this way.

## 3. Native backend assets

A piece often needs native code the Rust FFI alone can't express. Day gives each toolkit a local
extension path so that code lives in the piece crate:

> [!NOTE]
> **Implementing a *function* in another language? Use a bridge instead** ([bridge.md](bridge.md)).
> The per-toolkit paths below stage whole directories of hand-written shims, which is the right
> shape for a native **view** (a renderer wiring a `UIView`, a `QWidget`, an ArkUI component).
> daybridge is the shape for a native **call**: one Rust declaration, an implementation per
> platform written inline in the crate's own `.rs`, and generated glue on both sides.
> [day-part-speech](https://github.com/daybrite/day-part-speech) does six languages in one file that way, and
> `parts/day-part-battery` migrated its Android half off the `java = [...]` mechanism below.

### C++ shims: Qt & XAML (`build.rs`)

The piece carries its own `src/lib-qt-shim.cpp` / `src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp` and compiles them in `build.rs`
(gated on the feature). Qt widgets are plain C++ objects and the handle is a raw `QWidget*`, so a Qt
shim is self-contained. XAML handles are a private boxed type owned by `day-xaml-sys`, so the piece
boxes its XAML element through the exported `day_xaml_box` / `day_xaml_unbox` functions (a
stable WinRT COM-ABI). Both reuse the sys crate's generic `measure` (`day_qt_size_hint` /
`day_xaml_measure`).
See `pieces/day-piece-searchfield/{build.rs,src/lib-qt-shim.cpp,src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp}`.

### Android Java + Gradle deps (`[package.metadata.day.android]`)

The piece carries its own Java/Kotlin under a crate dir and declares it in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.day.android]
java = ["android/java"]                                        # → Gradle java srcDirs
res = ["android/res"]                                          # → Gradle res srcDirs (optional)
gradle-dependencies = ["com.google.android.material:material:1.11.0"]   # → app dependencies { }
gradle-repositories = ["https://jitpack.io"]                  # → extra Maven repos (optional)
permissions = ["android.permission.INTERNET"]                 # → <uses-permission> in the manifest
proguard = ["android/proguard-rules.pro"]                     # → R8 keep rules (see below)
manifest-components = ["android/components.xml"]              # → <receiver>/<service> (see below)
```

`day build` (for `android-mdc`) runs `cargo metadata`, walks the app's dependency closure, collects
every piece's contributions, and writes `build/day/android/day-pieces.json`. The app's checked-in
`platform/android/{app/build.gradle.kts,settings.gradle.kts}` read that file generically (a loop, so
per-piece edits are never needed) and add the Java dirs, res dirs, dependencies, and repos.

**Piece resources.** `res` dirs compile into the app's resource table, so a piece can ship the styles
or drawables its Java needs (e.g. a theme overlay for a dialog). The app's `R` package differs per
app, so the piece's Java resolves its own resources by name at runtime:
`ctx.getResources().getIdentifier("SomeStyleName", "style", ctx.getPackageName())`. Prefix names with
the piece to avoid collisions (resource names are one flat namespace per app).
`day-piece-datetime/android/res` is the reference.

**Manifest components.** A part whose Java half is a `BroadcastReceiver` or `Service` needs it
declared in the manifest, or Android never instantiates it. `manifest-components` names files
holding only the elements that belong inside `<application>` (`day build` adds the `<manifest>`
and `<application>` wrapper), and every class must be fully qualified, since the overlay merges
into an app whose package the part cannot know:

```xml
<!-- android/components.xml -->
<receiver android:name="dev.daybrite.day.notify.DayNotifyAlarmReceiver"
          android:exported="false" />
```

They merge into the same `day-pieces-manifest.xml` overlay the permissions use. A declared file
that is missing is a hard build error, not a warning, because a dropped receiver produces an APK
that installs, runs, and never delivers. A scaffold generated before this key existed gates the
overlay on the permission list being non-empty; `day build` warns, with the one-line fix, when a
part contributes components but no permissions.

**Manifest permissions.** A piece that needs a permission (a web view needs `INTERNET`) can't reach the
app's `AndroidManifest.xml`, so `day build` also writes the collected permissions into a generated
**overlay manifest** (`build/day/android/day-pieces-manifest.xml`). The scaffold points its debug +
release source-set manifests at that overlay, and AGP's manifest merger folds the `<uses-permission>`
entries into the app manifest (deduping against any the app already declares). So a WebView-using app
needs no manual manifest edit: the piece declares the permission and it shows up in the merged
manifest. `day-piece-webview` is the reference. (A piece can only add a permission; it never
removes or narrows the app's own.)

**Release minification (R8/ProGuard).** A `day build --profile release` (and `day pack`) minifies with
R8: it shrinks unused code and **renames** classes and methods. But Day reaches Java from native
(Rust) code *by name*: JNI `FindClass("dev/daybrite/day/piece/searchfield/DaySearch")`, `dcall_static` on a
method name, WorkManager instantiating a `Worker` from its class-name string, Room looking up a
`<Database>_Impl`. A renamed class breaks every one of those lookups, so an un-kept release APK
installs and then crashes at launch (`NoClassDefFound` / `ClassNotFoundException` / `UnsatisfiedLinkError`).

Two layers keep the right names.

- **The framework keeps its own namespace.** `day-android` ships a `proguard-rules.pro` (bundled by
  `day build` from the crate, like the Java shim) that keeps all of `dev.daybrite.day.**` (the render
  bridge and *every official Part/Piece shim*) plus every class with `native` methods. So a first-party
  piece needs no rules of its own. It also sets `-dontoptimize`: AGP forces the `proguard-android-optimize`
  base, whose aggressive optimizations break reflection-heavy libraries (WorkManager's Room database is
  the classic casualty), and Day accepts the size cost for predictable release builds. R8 still
  shrinks and renames everything a keep rule doesn't protect.

- **Everything outside `dev.daybrite.day.**` keeps itself.** An **app**'s own JNI classes (its install
  bridge, a background `Worker`) live in the *app's* package, and a **third-party piece** lives in its
  own namespace. Neither is covered by the framework rule. Each ships a `proguard-rules.pro` and lists
  it in `proguard = [...]`. `day build` collects all of them (framework + every piece + the app) into
  the release build's proguard configuration, exactly like it collects Java dirs and Gradle deps. An app
  also keeps here anything its *dependencies* reach reflectively that their own consumer rules miss
  (e.g. `-keep class * extends androidx.room.RoomDatabase { *; }` for a WorkManager user).

```proguard
# android/proguard-rules.pro — keep the classes native code reaches by name.
-keep class com.example.mypiece.MyPieceView { *; }
```

The app's `platform/android/app/build.gradle.kts` reads `dayProguardFile` + `proguardFiles` from
`day-pieces.json` and applies them in the `release` build type. `pieces/day-piece-searchfield` (framework
side) and App Fair's `android/proguard-rules.pro` (app side) are the references.

The piece's Java uses only day-android's public surface: `DayBridge.ctx` (the `Context`) and
`DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, kind, num, str)` (the event trampoline, `kind` per §14.2, `4` = selection).
The Rust side calls its own Java class through the re-exported `jni` (`with_env` +
`call_static_method` + `AHandle`); `day_android::make_view` is a convenience hardcoded to
`DayBridge`, so a standalone piece calls `day_android::try_make_view_on(env, ITS_CLASS, …)` (the
same non-panicking path with the class as a parameter) and falls back to `placeholder_view` on a
throw. See
`pieces/day-piece-searchfield/android/java/dev/daybrite/day/piece/searchfield/DaySearch.java`, and
`pieces/day-piece-texteditor/src/lib-android.rs` for the fallback.

> **Gradle configuration cache.** The scaffold reads `day-pieces.json` at *configuration* time, and
> `day build` rewrites it every build; the config cache can't track that read, so it would serve stale
> piece contributions. The scaffold ships with `org.gradle.configuration-cache=false` for this reason.
> Some pieces also pull libraries that require AndroidX (Lottie's view extends `AppCompatImageView`), so
> the scaffold sets `android.useAndroidX=true`.

### iOS Swift shims + SwiftPM packages (`[package.metadata.day.ios]`)

Many iOS libraries (and any Swift class with a non-`@objc` API) can't be driven from Rust directly, and
they ship as **SwiftPM packages**. A piece declares both in its `Cargo.toml`: the Swift shim it
carries, and the packages it needs.

```toml
[package.metadata.day.ios]
swift = ["ios/swift"]                                         # dirs of Swift shim sources
swift-packages = [                                           # SwiftPM package dependencies
  { url = "https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios", from = "4.5.0", products = ["Lottie"] },
]
frameworks = ["WebKit"]                                      # system frameworks to link
```

`frameworks` links system frameworks via the generated package's `linkerSettings`. A piece that
drives a class from an unlinked framework (e.g. a hand-rolled `WKWebView`) declares it here instead of
`dlopen`ing or hand-`#[link]`ing (which doesn't survive the cargo-staticlib → xcode link). `day-piece-webview`
uses `frameworks = ["WebKit"]`.

`{from, exact, branch, revision}` map to the matching SwiftPM version requirement; `products` are the
library products to link. Xcode is not script-driven like Gradle, so `day build` (ios-uikit) instead
generates a **local SwiftPM package** at `build/day/ios/DayPieces`. Its `Package.swift` lists every
piece's `swift-packages` as dependencies and compiles every piece's staged Swift shims (each under a
per-crate subfolder). The app's checked-in `.xcodeproj` depends on that one local package (the iOS
analog of the checked-in Gradle scaffold: a `XCLocalSwiftPackageReference` + a product dependency in a
Frameworks phase). So adding an iOS piece is pure `Cargo.toml` data; no `.xcodeproj` edits are needed.

Two further keys are shared with the macOS table below ([docs/swiftui.md](swiftui.md) covers them
in full):

- A `swift-packages` entry may be **local** (`{ path = "swiftui", products = ["MyViews"] }`,
  relative to the declaring crate). The package's transitive SwiftPM dependencies come along, and
  its public SwiftUI views are scanned and exported: generated hosting glue on this side, generated
  typed constructors (`crate::swiftui::MyView(…)`) on the Rust side. `products` defaults to the
  directory name.
- `platform = "16.0"` raises the generated package's minimum OS (the max across contributions
  wins). On iOS the CLI conveys it as an `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` command-line setting, which
  reaches the app and package targets without editing the scaffold; ⌘R builds in Xcode need the
  pbxproj raised by hand.

### macOS Swift (`[package.metadata.day.macos]`)

The macos-appkit leg uses the same table shape: `swift`, `swift-packages` (remote or local),
`frameworks`, `platform`. `day build` generates `build/day/macos/DayPieces` from the table and
the `platform/macos/DayApp.xcodeproj` host project's pbxproj references it; xcodebuild compiles
and links the package with the Runner, the same shape as iOS (the Swift runtime resolves against
the OS dylibs). `day-piece-swiftui` declares the same shim dir under both tables, one
`DaySwiftUI.swift` with `#if os(...)` arms.

### HarmonyOS ArkTS components (`[package.metadata.day.ohos]`)

Some HarmonyOS components exist **only in ArkTS**: the ArkUI **C** node API (`arkui/native_node.h`)
stops at the container kinds, so there is no way to construct a declarative `Web` (or `Map`) from
native code at all. A piece wrapping one carries its own ArkTS the way an Android piece carries Java.

```toml
[package.metadata.day.ohos]
ets = ["ohos/ets"]        # dirs of ArkTS sources; each needs an Index.ets exporting `dayPiece`
```

Each declared dir must contain an `Index.ets` exporting a `DayPieceModule`:

```ts
import { DayPieceModule } from '../DayPiece';           // generated next to the staged dirs

export const dayPiece: DayPieceModule = {
  kind: 'day.piece.webview',                            // matches the Rust KIND
  make: (ui, id, props) => frameNode | undefined,       // build it; undefined declines the kind
  update: (id, cmd, arg) => {},                         // the piece's own command vocabulary
  dispose: (id) => {}                                   // Day disposed the node — release it
};
```

`day build -p harmony-arkui` stages every piece's dirs under `entry/src/main/ets/daypieces/<crate>/`
(gitignored) and generates two files beside them: `DayPiece.ets` (the interface above) and
`DayPieces.ets`, whose `registerDayPieces(uiContext)` hands the native shim one factory, command sink,
and disposer for all pieces. The scaffold's host page calls it once, before `start()`, so adding an
ArkTS piece is pure `Cargo.toml` data, like the iOS leg, and the shim never grows a case per piece.

On the Rust side the renderer is the thinnest of all the backends, because there is no native widget
to build. `day_arkui::piece::make` returns the ArkTS component's FrameNode as an ordinary handle:

```rust
fn make(_b: &mut ArkUi, p: &WebProps, id: NodeId) -> AHandle { piece::make(KIND, id, &p.url) }
fn update(_b: &mut ArkUi, h: &AHandle, patch: &WebPatch) { piece::update(h, "load", url) }
```

Events come back through the shim's `pieceEvent(id, text)` as `Event::Custom`, the same open channel
(§8.2) the Android bridge uses, payload only. The bridge enforces two rules. A declined `make`
yields Day's placeholder leaf rather than a null handle (a null would take the whole parent's layout
down), and `release` routes an ArkTS-owned node to `dispose` instead of disposing it natively.

**Sizing.** Day owns layout and sets each node's position + size through the C API, so the ArkTS
component must not size itself with percentages: a `BuilderNode` is built detached, where `'100%'`
resolves against the whole window and the component covers the page.

The Swift shim exposes a flat C ABI (`@_cdecl`) that the piece's Rust calls (mirroring the Android Java
shim); it `import`s the SwiftPM product and returns a native `UIView` that Rust wraps via
`Retained::from_raw`. See `ios/swift/DayLottie.swift` and `src/lib-uikit.rs` in
[day-piece-lottie](https://github.com/daybrite/day-piece-lottie).

### The Android bridging contract

These are the guarantees a part or piece can rely on when its Rust calls its Java sidecar (all
provided by `day-android`, all exercised in production by `day-part-http`). A [daybridge](bridge.md)
arm rides these same guarantees (its generated JNI wrapper is written against them), so this list
is what that generated code does on your behalf, and what to know when you write the call by hand:

- **Any thread may call.** `day_android::with_env(|env| …)` attaches the calling thread to the
  JVM (and detaches scoped attachments). Blocking Java work runs on the caller's thread; keep
  it off the UI thread, exactly like any other blocking Rust.
- **App classes resolve from any thread.** `env.dfind`/`dcall_static`/`dfield` fall back to the
  app `ClassLoader` cached at startup, so a Rust-spawned worker resolves your sidecar class even
  though a bare JNI `FindClass` there only sees system classes.
- **Post to the UI thread** with `DayBridge.main.post(...)` on the Java side; on the Rust side,
  capture a `day_reactive::Setter` ([docs/focus.md](focus.md), DESIGN §4.5) rather than touching UI state
  from a worker.
- **Bulk payloads cross as one `byte[]` envelope**: `[status i32 BE][meta-len i32 BE]
  ["k\nv\n…" meta][payload]`; a negative status is your error sentinel with the message riding
  the meta block. Build it with `DayEnvelope.pack/error` in Java and parse it with
  `day_android::envelope::Envelope` in Rust; the two encode identically and Rust unit tests pin
  the format. There is one JNI copy each way and no per-field JNI traffic.
- **Piece-defined events** ride the `K_CUSTOM` kind (`DayBridge.nativeOnEvent(id, DayBridge.K_CUSTOM,
  num, text)` → `Event::Custom`): the tag can't cross JNI, so the piece reads the raw
  `num`/`text` payload. The full kind table is `day_spec::bridge::BridgeKind`; parity tests keep
  the Java constants in step.

## 4. Cargo wiring

```toml
[features]
appkit = ["dep:day-appkit", …]
gtk = ["dep:day-gtk", "dep:gtk4"]
qt = ["dep:day-qt"]                 # + a build.rs that compiles src/lib-qt-shim.cpp
uikit = ["dep:day-uikit", …]
mdc = ["dep:day-android"]        # + [package.metadata.day.android]
xaml = ["dep:day-xaml", "dep:day-xaml-sys"]   # + build.rs compiles src/lib-xaml-shim.cpp
```

The app mirrors each: `my-piece/<backend>` in the matching feature. Adding a piece needs no
changes to `day`, the toolkit crates, the CLI, or the Gradle scaffold.

**Dependency layering.** The extension graph stays acyclic by rule: **pieces may depend on
parts** (day-piece-remote-image → day-part-http is the shipped example) **and on core crates;
parts must not depend on `day-pieces` or any `day-piece-*`; tweaks may depend on `day-pieces`
(the built-ins they configure) but not on any satellite `day-piece-*` or `day-part-*`.** A
workspace test (`crates/day-cli/tests/layering.rs`) enforces this over `cargo metadata`, so a
violating dependency fails `cargo test`.

## 5. Container pieces (hosting a Day child)

A piece is not limited to leaves: it can be a **container** whose native view hosts a Day-built
subtree. day-core mounts children **by handle, not by kind** (the tree walks to the nearest native
ancestor and calls `Toolkit::insert(ancestor_handle, child_handle, index)` without consulting the
ancestor's kind), so a piece-realized node is a valid insertion parent on every backend. The recipe
(established by `pieces/day-piece-pullrefresh`, the reference container piece; see [docs/pullrefresh.md](pullrefresh.md)):

```rust
let node = cx.native(
    KIND,
    &MyProps { /* … */ },
    Rc::new(day_core::FrameLayout { width: None, height: None }), // child fills the container
    Flex { grow_w: true, grow_h: true, ..Default::default() },
    day_core::Boundary::Yes,
);
cx.under(node, |cx| { let _ = child.build(cx); });               // mount the Day child inside
```

- Supply a **layout** (`FrameLayout`/`PassThrough`, or your own `day_core::Layout`). A container
  node measures/places through its layout, not through the renderer's `measure` fn.
- Your per-backend `make` must return a **container-capable native view**: any `NSView`/`UIView`,
  any `QWidget`, any ArkUI FrameNode, but on GTK a `gtk4::Fixed`-backed view, on Android a
  `ViewGroup`, and on XAML a `Panel`, or the generic `insert` silently drops the child.
  (Native wrappers like Android's `SwipeRefreshLayout` are ViewGroups.)
- Events still flow through the single sink (`Event::Custom` for piece-defined ones) and commands
  through `with_tree(|t| t.patch(node, …))`, identical to leaf pieces.

## External toolkits: registering a platform-toolkit pair (experimental)

> [!WARNING]
> **The toolkit SPI is unstable.** Everything a backend implements (day-spec's `Toolkit` and
> `Platform` traits, `Event`, `Cap`, the per-kind props structs) evolves with this repository and
> is not published to crates.io. An external toolkit pins the day crates to a **git revision** and
> expects breakage between revisions. This section describes the `[package.metadata.day.toolkit]`
> registration, which is the part that will stay; the contract behind it firms up at SPI
> stabilization.

A toolkit implemented in its own repository registers its platform-toolkit pair by declaring it in
the toolkit crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.day.toolkit]
target = "netbsd-wxwidgets"    # <os>-<toolkit>; the toolkit half names the app's cargo feature
host = "any"                   # optional: restrict to "macos" | "linux" | "windows"
label = "wxWidgets"            # optional: pickers and error listings
doctor = "wx-config --version" # optional: `day doctor` probe (command + space-separated args)
```

The CLI resolves `-p <name>` against the builtin catalog first, then against declarations found in
the app's dependency graph (via `cargo metadata --all-features`, since the toolkit crate sits
behind the very feature its declaration names). A declared target inherits the **desktop**
pipeline. That is the only `kind` accepted today, because a new pipeline kind (another mobile
OS) means new build/launch/pack code in the CLI, which cannot come from a crate.

The app wires the toolkit the same way it would a builtin, plus one entry call:

```toml
# the app's Cargo.toml
[features]
wxwidgets = ["dep:day-toolkit-wx"]          # feature = the toolkit half of the target name

[dependencies]
day-toolkit-wx = { git = "…", optional = true }
```

```rust
// the app's main.rs — the toolkit's entry wraps `day::launch_external`, the cfg-free
// launcher that starts the dayscript engine exactly as the builtin launchers do.
#[cfg(feature = "wxwidgets")]
day_toolkit_wx::launch(options, root);
```

With `targets = ["netbsd-wxwidgets"]` in Day.toml, the target behaves like a builtin desktop
target: `day launch` (build + run + log streaming), `--script` walkthroughs, `day drive`,
`day stop`/`relaunch`, the session registry, `day doctor` (running the declared probe), `day
metadata` (the catalog entry carries `external: true` and the declaring `crate`), and `day lint`.

What a declared target does **not** get:

- **`day pack`** — packaging formats are per-OS CLI code; the guard says so explicitly.
- **`day new` / `day app add`** — scaffolding stays builtin; the toolkit crate documents its own
  project shape.
- **The in-repo pieces' native renderers:** `day-piece-webview` has no `wxwidgets` feature arm, so
  extension-piece kinds render Day's visible `⟨kind⟩` placeholders unless the external ecosystem
  ships renderer crates for its backend (the `Registry`/`renderer!` registration path is the same
  one in-repo pieces use). The built-in vocabulary is the backend's own `realize`: cover what you
  support and placeholder the rest; the `assert_no_placeholders` allow-lists record which kinds
  still render a placeholder on each backend.

## Reference

`pieces/day-piece-searchfield` implements all of the above: a native search input on six backends,
its own Qt + XAML C++ shims, and its own Android Java. It's verified on AppKit / GTK / Qt / iOS /
Android and CI-built on XAML. Use it as a template. Its layout keeps the shared front-end and each
toolkit backend in a separate file:

```
pieces/day-piece-searchfield/
├── Cargo.toml               # features + [package.metadata.day.android]
├── build.rs                 # compiles lib-qt-shim.cpp / lib-xaml-shim.cpp per feature
├── android/java/…/DaySearch.java   # this piece's own Android backend
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs               # front-end (the `Piece`) + `day_pieces::glue_modules!(…)`
    ├── lib-appkit.rs        # one file per toolkit renderer …
    ├── lib-gtk.rs
    ├── lib-qt.rs            (+ lib-qt-shim.cpp)
    ├── lib-uikit.rs
    ├── lib-android.rs      (+ android/java DaySearch.java)
    ├── lib-xaml.rs        (+ lib-xaml-shim.cpp)
    ├── lib-qt-shim.cpp
    └── lib-xaml-shim.cpp
```

`lib.rs` declares the backends with one `day_pieces::glue_modules!(appkit, gtk, qt, uikit, mdc,
xaml)` line (§2), so every `lib-<toolkit>.rs` is compiled only for its feature+target and the whole
native surface for a toolkit lives in one place.

`pieces/day-piece-webview` (see [webview.md](webview.md)) is a second reference: a heavier native
backend (an embedded browser) that additionally contributes an Android permission, hand-rolls the iOS
`WKWebView` (`dlopen`-ing WebKit.framework so the piece stays self-contained), and returns the proposal
from `measure` so a growing leaf fills on Android.

[day-piece-lottie](https://github.com/daybrite/day-piece-lottie) is a third reference, and the first
piece to live in its own repository: an iOS/Android-only piece that pulls an external native package
on each platform, the lottie-ios SwiftPM package (via the `[package.metadata.day.ios]` mechanism
above) and `com.airbnb.android:lottie` (Gradle). Its Swift and Java shims each wrap a
`LottieAnimationView` behind a flat C ABI / static method. It is also the reference for an external
repository: bare canonical `git = "https://github.com/daybrite/day.git"` dependencies with no ref (so
the consuming app's `Cargo.lock` picks one day revision for the whole graph), a
`[package.metadata.day] compat = "0.4"` line naming the day minor it was tested against, a `demo/`
app whose dayscript is the on-device test, and a headless `model` module tested on the host. In
this tree, `scripts/ci/scaffold-check.sh` keeps `swift-packages` exercised on the ios-uikit leg
with a fixture piece that pulls swift-collections.

[day-part-speech](https://github.com/daybrite/day-part-speech) is the reference for the other mechanism, and the
first **part** to live in its own repository: a headless part whose every platform implementation
is a [bridge](bridge.md) arm — Swift, Java, ArkTS, JavaScript, C++, and C — inline in one
`src/lib.rs` beside the Rust declaration they share. Its `docs/speech.md` walks through the arms.
[day-piece-camera](https://github.com/daybrite/day-piece-camera) is a fourth: a native camera
on the three mobile toolkits — a Swift shim that reports back through a C function pointer, a
Java class over CameraX that is its own `LifecycleOwner`, and a HarmonyOS arm where the ArkTS
half only hosts an `XComponent` surface and a C shim over the NDK camera kit (compiled by the
crate's own `build.rs`) owns the session. It is also the first piece to declare
`[package.metadata.day.permissions] uses = ["camera"]`, and the app supplies the reason.

As an external repository it follows the same rules as day-piece-lottie above: bare canonical day
dependencies, a `compat` line, and a `demo/` app whose dayscript is the on-device test.

`parts/day-part-battery` (see [battery.md](battery.md)) is a fourth reference, the first **part**:
a headless crate with no UI Piece at all. Where `pieces/` holds UI-library extensions (each
registers a renderer), `parts/` is the non-UI counterpart: capability crates (`day-part-*`) that extend
Day apps with platform services. It shows the backend-contribution mechanism accommodates non-UI
capabilities: it contributes Android Java (for `BatteryManager`, now through a
[bridge](bridge.md) arm) but registers nothing into any `RENDERERS` slice, and selects its per-OS impl by
`#[cfg(target_os)]` rather than a toolkit feature. Any Rust code can depend on it and call
`day_part_battery::status()`.
