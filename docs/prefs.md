# Persistent preferences (headless capability crate)

> **Status: implemented** as `day-part-prefs` (in `parts/`, the headless counterpart of `pieces/`).
> It's a headless day-ecosystem crate (no UI Piece): a shared cross-platform API for a small persistent
> **string key/value store**, backed by each platform's native preferences facility. Verified on macOS
> (real round-trip through `NSUserDefaults`); iOS-sim / Android (Rust side) / HarmonyOS / Linux all
> clippy-clean and cross-compile.
>
> **Promoted into the facade (2026-08): reach for `day::prefs`.** Nearly every app wants settings, and
> this is the one part that lives in the reactive layer (`bind`) and backs a core framework feature
> (`.restore(key)` navigation), so `day` depends on it behind a **default-on `prefs` feature** and
> re-exports it as `day::prefs`. Apps need no separate dependency. It is still its own crate, so a
> direct `day-part-prefs` dependency and the `day_part_prefs::…` paths keep working unchanged; the two
> spellings are the same API. Decline it with `day = { …, default-features = false }`, which drops the
> Apple `NSUserDefaults` dependency and the Android `SharedPreferences` Java shim.

## Authoring

```rust
day::prefs::set("greeting", "hello");                // persist a value
assert_eq!(day::prefs::get("greeting").as_deref(), Some("hello"));
assert!(day::prefs::contains("greeting"));
day::prefs::remove("greeting");                      // delete it
```

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `set(key, value) -> bool` | Persist `value` under `key`, overwriting. `true` when the write committed. |
| `get(key) -> Option<String>` | The stored string, or `None` if absent. A stored `""` is `Some("")`. |
| `remove(key) -> bool` | Delete the value; `true` only if it existed and was removed. |
| `contains(key) -> bool` | Whether a value is currently stored under `key`. |
| `bind(key, signal)` | Two-way-bind a `Signal<T>` to a stored value: seed from the store now, persist every later change. `T` round-trips through `FromStr`/`ToString`. Call it right after creating the signal; the write-back stops with the creating scope. |
| `install_nav_store()` | Install this store as day-core's navigation-persistence sink, so a `nav`/`nav_stack` marked `.restore(key)` remembers its state across launches (and an Android process death). Call once in `main`, before the UI mounts. Nav keys are namespaced under `day.nav.`. See [navigation](navigation.md). |

Values persist across launches. The crate has no cargo features: platform
selection is purely `#[cfg(target_os)]` (plus `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` for the web),
since persistence depends on the OS, not on which widget toolkit is in use. `parts/day-part-prefs/examples/prefs.rs` is a plain `main` that uses it with no
Day framework at all (run it twice to watch a value survive the process).

This is a small string store for user settings and lightweight app state, not a database. Keep
values modest; large blobs belong in a file.

## Per-platform native realization

| OS | API | dependency |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `NSUserDefaults.standard` | `objc2` + `objc2-foundation`, shared `apple.rs` |
| iOS | `NSUserDefaults.standard` | `objc2` + `objc2-foundation`, shared `apple.rs` |
| Android | `SharedPreferences` (`MODE_PRIVATE`) via a Java shim | `day-android` + `[package.metadata.day.android]` |
| Linux | file store under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/day` (or `~/.config/day`) | std only, shared `file.rs` |
| Windows | file store under `%APPDATA%\day` | std only, shared `file.rs` |
| HarmonyOS | file store, best-effort in the app sandbox (`target_env = "ohos"`) | std only, shared `file.rs` |
| Web | `localStorage` (per origin, `day.pref.` namespace) via the day-dom shim | the `web-dom` host page ([docs/web.md](web.md)), `web.rs` |

## What each platform does

- **macOS / iOS**: `NSUserDefaults.standard` is the system's per-application preferences store (a
  plist under `~/Library/Preferences` on macOS, the app container on iOS). It is toolkit-independent
  (no `NSApplication`/`UIApplication`, run loop, or window), so the crate works in `day-qt` binaries
  and plain `cargo test` processes as well as under `day-appkit`/`day-uikit`. `setObject:forKey:` is
  the only `unsafe` objc2 call (the value must be a property-list type, and we always pass a real
  `NSString`); writes are immediately readable and flushed to disk by the system. `set` always
  returns `true`.
- **Android**: an app-private `SharedPreferences` file named `day_part_prefs`, opened with
  `Context.MODE_PRIVATE` from `day-android`'s cached `Context` (`DayBridge.ctx`). Writes use
  `Editor.commit()` (synchronous), so `set`/`remove` return the true commit result. No manifest
  permission is required; `SharedPreferences` is private storage. Like the UI pieces, the crate
  stages its own Java shim through `[package.metadata.day.android]` and rides the Day runtime (it
  needs the app's JVM + `Context`).
- **Linux / Windows / HarmonyOS**: a file-backed store, one flat `String -> String` map serialized
  under `<config-dir>/day/day-part-prefs.store`. `config-dir` is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (else `~/.config`)
  on Linux, `%APPDATA%` (else `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming`) on Windows, and a best-effort app files
  dir on HarmonyOS. Each entry is a line `escaped_key=escaped_value`; the escaper removes every raw
  `=`, newline, and carriage return (`\` → `\\`, newline → `\n`, CR → `\r`, `=` → `\e`), so the first
  raw `=` on a line is unambiguously the separator and a value may contain anything. Writes are
  best-effort atomic (write a sibling temp file, then rename over the target); a process-wide mutex
  serializes load-modify-save cycles. Every read tolerates a missing, unreadable, or corrupt file
  by treating the store as empty, so a partial write or a hand-edit can never panic a caller. `set`
  returns `false` only when the store file could not be written (e.g. a read-only home). It depends
  on `std` only.
- **Web (web-dom)**: `localStorage`, reached through the day-dom host shim's `day_dom_pref_*`
  imports under a `day.pref.` key namespace. Values survive reloads and browser restarts,
  scoped per origin. `localStorage` can throw (private browsing, storage pressure); failures
  report as uncommitted/absent, matching the contract everywhere else. The showcase's Controls
  page binds its state through this store, so a reload keeps the counter ([docs/web.md](web.md)). On
  wasm outside a day-dom host page the imports are unresolved and instantiation fails.
- **Any other platform**: a no-op store: `set`/`remove`/`contains` return `false`, `get` returns
  `None`.

## What it shows about the extension system

Like `day-part-battery` and `day-part-network`, this is a headless external crate: it has no UI Piece
and registers nothing in any backend's `RENDERERS` slice. On Android it stages its own Java shim
through `[package.metadata.day.android]` (with no permission this time, since private storage needs
none), which `day build` folds into the app's Gradle build without touching any core day crate. On
every other platform it is fully day-independent (pure FFI on Apple, pure `std` file I/O on desktop).
See [docs/extending.md](extending.md).

## Settings pieces + the env-wins rule ([docs/windows.md](windows.md))

`pieces/day-piece-settings` packages the theme/language settings rows every app was
hand-rolling. `appearance_picker`/`language_picker`/`settings_sections` persist through
this part and apply live. Its `apply_startup(theme_key, locale_key)` applies persisted
overrides at boot with the **env-wins rule**: when `DAY_THEME` or `DAY_LOCALE` is set (a
`day launch --env`/`--locale` run, every themed CI variant), the persisted value is not
re-applied; the launch override stays deterministic no matter what an earlier run stored.
Live picker changes still apply and persist after boot. When testing persistence by hand on
macOS, unbundled binaries store under the process-name defaults domain (`defaults delete <name>`
clears it; a plist delete alone won't, because cfprefsd caches).
