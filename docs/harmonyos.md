# HarmonyOS Next: the ArkUI backend (§9)

HarmonyOS Next dropped the AOSP layer; its UI framework is **ArkUI**. Day targets it with a native
backend (`day-arkui`) built on the **ArkUI Native NodeAPI**, using the same "real native widgets, Day
owns layout" model as every other backend, adapted to HarmonyOS's ArkTS-hosted world. `harmony-arkui`
is [Tier 3](https://daybrite.dev/docs/platforms#support-tiers): tested, but not comprehensively, and
not yet exercised by shipping applications.

## Architecture

It mirrors the Android backend: a managed UI runtime (ArkTS) hosts the window, native Rust builds the
widget tree over a thin bridge, and Day owns absolute layout.

```
ArkTS host (Index.ets)           libentry.so (Rust cdylib)
  NodeContent slot  ──start()──▶  day-arkui-sys  (C++ shim over the ArkUI NodeAPI + NAPI)
  ContentSlot(content)            day-arkui      (Toolkit/Platform: Stack/Text/Button/…)
        ▲                         day-core / day-pieces / day-fluent / day-script
        └── OH_ArkUI_NodeContent_AddNode ── the native tree Day builds is mounted here
```

The ArkTS host is the framework's, not the app's. It lives in the day-arkui crate at
`toolkits/day-arkui/platform/harmony/` — `ets/` holds `EntryAbility`, `DayWindowAbility`, the
`Index` page and the secondary-window `DayWindow` page; `types/Index.d.ts` declares the native
module's exports, so it always matches the `day-arkui-sys` shim the app links. `day build`
(and `day prepare`/`day open`) resolves the crate through cargo metadata and stages the
directory into the app's hvigor project: the pages and abilities under
`entry/src/main/ets/day/`, the typings (with their `oh-package.json5`) under
`entry/src/main/cpp/types/libentry/`, plus the generated page list and start-window colors.
All of it is gitignored — the same arrangement as the Java shim Gradle reads from
`day-android`. What an app checks in is the hvigor skeleton alone: the build profiles,
`AppScope/app.json5`, `module.json5` (whose `srcEntry` paths name the staged files), the
string tables, and the `hvigor` config. An app that predates this (2026-09) still carries its
own copies under `ets/pages/` and `ets/entryability/`; `day build` leaves those alone and
prints a note on how to adopt the staged host.

- **`day-arkui-sys`**: a C++ shim (like `day-qt-sys`/`day-xaml-sys`) exposing a flat C ABI over
  `arkui/native_node.h` (`createNode`/`setAttribute`/`addChild`/`registerNodeEvent`/`measureNode`),
  `arkui/native_node_napi.h` (`NodeContent`), and `napi/native_api.h`. It also registers the NAPI
  module (`entry`) whose `start(nodeContent, widthVp, heightVp, density)` kicks off Day, wires the
  global node-event receiver back to Rust, and posts to the main (JS) thread via libuv `uv_async`.
- **`day-arkui`**: the `Toolkit`/`Platform` impl. Pieces map to ArkUI node types
  (`ARKUI_NODE_STACK` for containers, `TEXT`, `BUTTON`, `TEXT_INPUT`, `TOGGLE`, `SLIDER`), children
  get an explicit position + size in **vp** (≈ Day points), and events (click / text / toggle /
  slider) come back through `day_arkui_on_event`.
- **`day::day_start_arkui!(root)`**: exports `day_arkui_start`, the symbol the shim's NAPI `start` calls;
  it mounts the app's root piece and runs the loop (`day::arkui::start` → `launch_with`). Apps
  reach it through `day::day_start!("App Name", root)`, which expands to this macro and to every
  other platform's entry; the title argument is ignored here, since the label comes from
  `AppScope/resources/base/element/string.json`.

## Local development environment

1. **OpenHarmony SDK / NDK.** Easiest: install the **command-line-tools** (see Build & run), one
   bundle carrying the NDK + hvigor + ohpm + node + signing material, and point `OHOS_NDK_HOME` at
   its `sdk/default/openharmony/native`. For a Rust-only cross-compile you can instead grab just the
   `native` NDK component from the public SDK (no account needed):

   ```bash
   curl -LO https://repo.huaweicloud.com/openharmony/os/6.0-Release/L2-SDK-MAC-M1-PUBLIC.tar.gz
   # extract → .../ohos-sdk/packages/ohos-sdk/darwin/native-*.zip → unzip → .../native
   export OHOS_NDK_HOME=/path/to/ohos-sdk/native
   ```

2. **Rust OHOS targets** (Tier 2 std via rustup; Homebrew rustc has none):

   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos x86_64-unknown-linux-ohos
   ```

   The NDK ships the linker wrappers `$OHOS_NDK_HOME/llvm/bin/<target>-clang`; point cargo at them
   with `CARGO_TARGET_<TARGET>_LINKER`. (`day build` sets this itself, along with `CC_<target>`/
   `AR_<target>` pointing at the NDK's clang and llvm-ar so `cc-rs` build scripts (e.g. `ring`
   under day-part-http's rustls fallback) cross-compile too; the exports only matter if you drive
   bare cargo.)

## Check your environment first

`day doctor --toolkit harmonyos` reports exactly which of the pieces below are present or missing,
with setup instructions:

```bash
day doctor --toolkit harmonyos
```

Bare `day doctor` (no `--toolkit`) scans every toolkit and reports a missing HarmonyOS setup as a
warning rather than an error, since you only need it if you build for HarmonyOS.

## Build & run

The build has two halves with different tool needs:

1. **The Rust cross-compile** (`libentry.so`) needs only the OpenHarmony **NDK**, the `native`
   component of the public SDK, which downloads without a Huawei account. Point `OHOS_NDK_HOME` at it.
   `hdc` (for install/launch) sits in the SDK's sibling `toolchains/` dir; `day` finds it there
   automatically, or you can put it on `PATH`.
2. **Packaging the `.hap`** needs `hvigor` + `ohpm`. These are not in the public SDK; they ship with
   the OpenHarmony **command-line-tools** (bundled with DevEco Studio, or the Linux-x64 bundle at
   `repo.huaweicloud.com/harmonyos/ohpm/<ver>/`). Put their `bin/` on `PATH`.

The showcase's `platform/harmony/` project targets **OpenHarmony** (`runtimeOS: "OpenHarmony"`,
`compileSdkVersion`/`compatibleSdkVersion` = the integer API level), which matches the Oniro emulator
and avoids the HMS-only `libimage_transcoder_shared` library that only DevEco Studio ships, so the
whole flow works login-free on macOS and Linux.

**macOS note.** The Linux command-line-tools hvigor/ohpm are pure JavaScript, so they run under
system `node` via a two-line wrapper even though the bundle is packaged for Linux:

```bash
cat > ~/ohos/bin/hvigorw <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec node "$HOME/ohos-clt/command-line-tools/hvigor/bin/hvigorw.js" "$@"
SH
cat > ~/ohos/bin/ohpm <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec node "$HOME/ohos-clt/command-line-tools/ohpm/bin/pm-cli.js" "$@"
SH
chmod +x ~/ohos/bin/hvigorw ~/ohos/bin/ohpm
```

Point `OHOS_NDK_HOME` at the public mac SDK's `native` dir and `OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME` at a versioned
SDK layout (`<dir>/<api>/…`, e.g. a symlink `18 -> .../openharmony`).

```bash
cd Day-Showcase/platform/harmony

# 0) Stage the framework's ArkTS host + the pieces' ArkTS into the project (gitignored):
day prepare -p harmony-arkui

# 1) Cross-compile the app to libentry.so for the emulator (x86_64) and device (arm64):
./build.sh both                                # drops entry/libs/<abi>/libentry.so

# 2) Assemble an (unsigned) .hap with hvigor; build-profile.json5 declares no signingConfig:
ohpm install
hvigorw assembleHap --mode module -p product=default -p buildMode=debug --no-daemon

# 3) Patch + sign it with the OpenHarmony public release material (no account/secrets needed).
#    sign-hap.mjs — the CLI's own script, written to build/day/harmony/ by `day build` — rewrites
#    module.json's compileSdkType to "OpenHarmony" so the emulator skips code-sign verification
#    (an OpenHarmony device does not trust the public cert's code signature, install error
#    9568393, but skips the check entirely for OpenHarmony-declared apps), then signs the
#    provision profile + the .hap. Run from the platform/harmony/ project (it reads AppScope/app.json5):
node ../../build/day/harmony/sign-hap.mjs entry/build/*/outputs/*/entry-default-unsigned.hap \
  entry/build/showcase-signed.hap

# 4) Launch the HarmonyOS emulator, then install/run:
hdc install entry/build/showcase-signed.hap
hdc shell aa start -b dev.daybrite.showcase -a EntryAbility
```

(Opening `platform/harmony/` in DevEco Studio and pressing Run ▶ with auto-sign does all of 2–4 too.)

You don't run any of the above by hand; `day launch -p harmony-arkui` does the whole flow
(cross-compile → hvigor → sign → install → start), and `day` brings up the emulator too:

```bash
# A native OpenHarmony emulator window (QEMU cocoa on macOS; no VNC, no password, no DevEco).
# Point DAY_OHOS_EMULATOR at the Oniro image dir (default ~/ohos/emulator/images); --headless for CI.
day ohos emulator launch

# Then build + install + launch the app on every connected target (see "Multiple devices" below):
day launch --project Day-Showcase -p harmony-arkui
```

## Multiple devices / architectures

`day launch -p harmony-arkui` enumerates every reachable `hdc` target, queries each one's arch
(`uname -m` → x86_64 emulator / arm64 device), builds a `libentry.so` for **each** arch, and packs
them all into the one `.hap` (`libs/x86_64/` + `libs/arm64-v8a/`) so it installs on any of them.
It then installs + starts the app on **every** connected target. Android (`adb`, per-device
`ro.product.cpu.abi`) and iOS (every booted simulator) do the same: one `day launch` fans out to
all connected devices, building whatever ABIs they need.

## Status

`harmony-arkui` is a maintained target. Pieces render as ArkUI Native NodeAPI nodes, verified
on the Oniro emulator:

- **Nav shell** (`nav`) — a scrollable list that pushes detail pages.
- **Controls** — `Text`, `Button`, `TextInput`, native `Slider` / `Toggle`, a determinate `Progress`
  bar + an indeterminate `LoadingProgress` spinner, and `Divider` hairlines.
- **Canvas** (§11) — an `ARKUI_NODE_CUSTOM` node whose on-draw callback replays Day's display list
  with **OH_Drawing** (arcs, fills, strokes, rounded-rects, ellipses, text): the gauge + shapes pages.
- **List** (§10) — an `ARKUI_NODE_LIST` driven by an `OH_ArkUI_NodeAdapter` with cell reuse, so a
  500-row list only builds the visible cells.
- **Tabs** — an `ARKUI_NODE_SWIPER` pager with a dot indicator.
- **Gestures** — `.on_tap` (NODE_ON_CLICK) and `.on_drag` (a native pan recognizer via the
  NDK gesture API, reported on the shared kind-11 wire in px). Long-press is not wired.
- **Scrolling** (§7.6) — `scroll()` is a real `ARKUI_NODE_SCROLL` whose day children live in a
  shim-owned container sized by `set_scroll_content`; without it the Scroll measures a content
  extent of 0 (day's content nodes are layout-only) and neither touch nor `scroll_to` moves.
- **Frame clock** (§8.4) — `Platform::request_frame` rides a ~16 ms one-shot `uv_timer` on the
  JS loop (the NodeAPI has no re-armable vsync callback), so `frame_clock` game loops and
  self-driven animations run; Day-Games' breakout/sirtet/2048 play on the emulator.
- **Fullscreen cover** ([docs/cover.md](cover.md)) — `Cap::Cover` answers `Emulated`: the cover node is
  re-homed onto the window root at full bounds (no transition, no gesture dismissal).

- **ArkTS-built pieces** ([docs/extending.md](extending.md)) — a piece whose component exists only in ArkTS (the
  declarative `Web` has no ArkUI C node kind) ships its own `.ets`; `day build` stages it into the
  hvigor project and generates `entry/src/main/ets/daypieces/DayPieces.ets`, which the host page
  registers with the shim (`registerPiece`) before `start()`. `day-piece-webview` is the first user.
  **ArkWeb does not run on the x86_64 emulator**: the image's `ArkWebCore.hap` carries arm64-only
  native libs, so `libarkweb_engine.so` never loads (`GetNWeb: web engine is nullptr`) and the
  component's RosenWeb surface wedges the window's compositor for the rest of the process; every
  later frame goes stale. The showcase walkthrough therefore skips the web-view page on
  harmony-arkui; the arm path is unaffected.

Images/lottie/map pieces are not yet wired (they render as placeholders). Packaging + signing
run headlessly via the command-line-tools (see Build & run) with no Huawei developer account: hvigor
assembles the `.hap` and `sign-hap.mjs` patches (compileSdkType → OpenHarmony) + signs it with the
public release material. `libentry.so` links the NDK's shared libc++ and `libnative_drawing`, both
packed into the `.hap`.

## CI

The `harmony-arkui` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR (`macos-14`). The build
gates **hard** (clippy + cross-compile + `hvigorw assembleHap` + sign + `day doctor`); only the
emulator boot + walkthrough are best-effort (`continue-on-error` per step) because the GitHub-hosted
TCG emulator is slow and occasionally flaky. It downloads + caches the OpenHarmony
**command-line-tools** (~2 GB) and then runs the real build pipeline:

1. clippy the backend for the OHOS target, and cross-compile the full Day app to `libentry.so` for
   the emulator (x86_64) and device (arm64) using the darwin SDK's NDK clang;
2. `ohpm install`, then `hvigorw assembleHap`, a full hvigor build of the ArkTS host + `.hap`;
3. patch + sign the `.hap` with `sign-hap.mjs` (compileSdkType → OpenHarmony + the public release
   material), then install/launch it on the Oniro emulator over `hdc` and drive the dayscript
   walkthrough, uploading screenshots for the gallery, like the other targets. CI boots the emulator
   with `day ohos emulator launch --headless` (the same Oniro v6.1 image openharmony-rs's
   emulator-action uses) rather than the action itself: the action's QEMU command has **no GPU
   device** (`-nographic`), so the guest has no display: the keyguard never dismisses, `aa start`
   is refused with error 10106102, and screenshots capture nothing. Day's launcher adds
   `-device virtio-gpu-pci` with `-display none`: a headless framebuffer the apps can foreground on
   and `uitest screenCap` can capture.

Declaring the app OpenHarmony (via the compileSdkType patch) lets it install: the emulator
enforces app code signing but doesn't trust the public cert, and OpenHarmony's BMS skips code-sign
verification for OpenHarmony-declared apps on devices without Huawei OH code signing.

The whole job (build gates and emulator screenshots) runs on a single **macOS** runner: the
x86_64 Oniro guest is TCG-emulated on every GitHub runner, and only the macOS ARM hosts run it
fast enough for the pipeline (first-boot keyguard render → wake + swipe-unlock → walkthrough);
the ubuntu hosts never got that far. Build steps gate hard; only the emulator boot + walkthrough
are per-step best-effort. The setup replicates the validated local macOS flow: the Linux
command-line-tools (hvigor/ohpm are pure JS) run through node wrapper scripts, the darwin
API-18 SDK from setup-ohos-sdk supplies the NDK + hdc + the versioned `OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME`
view hvigor builds against, and Day's QEMU launcher boots the image. `OHOS_BASE_SDK_HOME`
must be a **host-platform** SDK: hvigor spawns its native tools (`syscap_tool`, `restool`,
`es2abc`) directly, so pointing it at the Linux CLT's bundled SDK fails on macOS with
`spawn ENOEXEC` at `SyscapTransform`.

The scripted channel depends on the following facts, each of which was a silent total failure
until diagnosed:

- **The default hdc forward port 55555 is often already occupied**, since GitHub's macOS runners
  hold it, and so do some local services; QEMU then dies instantly ("Could not set up host
  forwarding rule"), leaving no reachable target and blank screenshot sets. `day ohos emulator
  launch` probes and slides to the first free port, `tconn`s the chosen key (so device discovery
  finds it), and exports `DAY_OHOS_TARGET` through `GITHUB_ENV` so later CI steps target it too.

- **`ohos.permission.INTERNET` is required for the loopback dayscript socket**; without it in
  `module.json5` the engine's `TcpListener::bind` fails silently and no scripted run can ever
  connect (the Android manifest needs the same permission for the same reason).
- **The ability is a singleton**: a second `aa start` foregrounds the existing process, whose
  engine (if any) listens on the previous run's port. `day launch` force-stops the bundle
  before every start so each run's engine params take effect.
- **The keyguard returns whenever the display sleeps** and `aa start` is refused while it shows;
  `day launch` wakes + swipe-unlocks (uitest + uinput) around every launch retry.
- **ArkUI Navigation diffs the old and new stacks by destination name**, so a same-turn pop+push
  of two destinations with the same generic name collapses into "page is not change — don't
  transition", leaving the old (already-detached, empty) destination on screen for good. The
  host page pushes each Day page under a unique `day-page-<key>` name, and dayscript-driven
  sessions push/pop **without** transition animation (ArkUI drops an operation issued across an
  in-flight transition; scripted bursts outrun one).
- **`uitest screenCap` trails the UI tree**, because the TCG guest's RenderService composites a
  pushed page seconds after it has laid out, so a shot taken right after a navigation shows the
  previous page. The runner waits for `ui_idle` (the pushed destination's first area report),
  sleeps `DAY_OHOS_SHOT_SETTLE_MS` (default 4000) before capturing, and re-captures when a shot
  comes out byte-identical to the run's previous one (the first push after app start can lag
  past the settle while the render tree warms up).

## Follow-ups

Wire the remaining pieces (image / lottie / map), richer accessibility (roles beyond the
label), interactive tab-bar labels on the swiper, and the image/webview backends. The dayscript
engine's TCP channel is flaky on the TCG emulator (occasional connection resets), so scripted
walkthrough screenshots on OHOS are best-effort. Canvas fonts and the font list
([docs/fonts.md](fonts.md)) compile against `OH_Drawing_FontMgr` and are verified by CI on a
device. A family the ability registered through `font.registerFont` is NOT visible to
`OH_Drawing_FontMgrMatchFamilyStyle` (the 2026-09 showcase drew canvas text in the system face
while its labels were right), so the toolkit builds a typeface from each bundled font's bytes
and the canvas draws from that.
