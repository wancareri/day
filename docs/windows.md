# Secondary windows (§8.1)

> **Status: implemented** on every backend. Desktop: AppKit, GTK, Qt native (runtime-
> verified) and XAML native (compile-verified on the windows-xaml CI leg; its runtime pass
> and per-window screenshot capture are follow-ups noted below). Mobile: `Normal` windows
> are native where the platform has a real secondary-window surface: iPad UIScenes (the
> uikit backend runs the scene lifecycle now), Android document-style `DayWindowActivity`
> instances, and OHOS multiton `DayWindowAbility` instances; iPhone and the `Preferences`
> kind on all mobile present as a fullscreen cover in the primary window (the platform
> settings idiom): same API, ids, and close path. web answers `Unsupported` (a second
> browser window cannot share the wasm instance) and always takes the cover. Verified by
> mock e2e (`crates/day-pieces/tests/mock_e2e.rs`, the window suite), the showcase
> walkthrough's preferences leg (369/369 on appkit, gtk, qt, ios-sim, android-emulator,
> and the OHOS emulator), the desktop `dayscript/windows.yaml` / `windows-theme.yaml`
> scripts, and second-window emulator captures on Android and OHOS.

One tree has many roots: a secondary window's content container is adopted as an additional
boundary root of the same thread-local tree (the `create_cell_anchor` trick the primary root
and list cells already use), laid out at that window's own size. Bindings, `find_by_id`,
navigation state, and dayscript therefore work across windows with no window parameter;
element ids stay globally unique, and a control in one window can drive a label in another
through ordinary signals.

## Titles: what the platform manages windows by

Every platform's automatic window management identifies a window by its **title**, and supplies
no fallback when there isn't one. On macOS an untitled window is skipped when AppKit builds the
Window menu and shows a blank tab in a tab group; on iPad it is an unlabeled card in the app
switcher; on Android an unlabeled recents entry; on GTK/Qt/Windows an unlabeled entry in the
window list or taskbar. So a window with no title is missing from every place the system lists
windows.

These rules keep that from happening:

- A window opened by File ▸ New Window **inherits the app's launch `WindowOptions`** (the title,
  minimum size, and display name the app handed `launch`). An app needs no code for this; a new
  window is another window of the same app and describes itself that way.
- `day::window_title(|| …)` binds the title of the window the calling piece is building into, so
  a window names itself after what it shows. It is reactive like any binding, and window-scoped:
  the target is resolved once, at build, exactly as a toolbar contribution resolves its own.

```rust
fn window_shell() -> impl Piece {
    Scene::scoped(|scene| {
        day::window_title(move || match scene.selected.get() {
            Some(id) => scene.name_of(id),
            None => app_title(),
        });
        my_ui(scene)
    })
}
```

Two windows sharing one title are two windows the user cannot tell apart in the Window menu, the
tab bar, Mission Control, or the app switcher, so title them by content wherever there is content
to name. `WindowHandle::set_title` remains the imperative form for a window you hold a handle to.

**The platform places windows.** macOS staggers each new window from the last
(`cascadeTopLeftFromPoint:`) rather than centering it, since two centered windows would hide each
other, and remembers the primary window's frame between launches under an autosave name. That restore is
turned off while `DAY_SCRIPT` or `DAY_WINDOW` is set, so captured screenshots keep the size the
script asked for instead of the size the developer last dragged. Every other desktop leaves
placement to its window manager, which is that platform's convention.

`WindowKind::Preferences` is centered and kept out of the macOS Window menu, the convention stock
apps follow.

## Opening windows

```rust
let win = day::open_window(
    Some("detail:AAPL"),                  // key: open-or-focus singleton; None = always new
    WindowOptions { title: "AAPL".into(), size: Size::new(720.0, 640.0), ..Default::default() },
    WindowKind::Normal,                   // or WindowKind::Preferences
    || detail_page("AAPL"),               // built under the new window's root
);
win.set_title("AAPL — live");
win.on_close(|| println!("gone"));
win.close();                              // async: confirmed by the platform, THEN torn down
```

- `key` names the logical window: opening an already-open key focuses it instead of
  duplicating, which is how `day.preferences` stays a singleton. `window_by_key` finds it later.
  A key reopened while its window is still *closing* is the same window arriving again: on the
  cover tier that reverses the hide transition and keeps the content that is already there,
  rather than handing back a surface the pending confirmation is about to dispose.
- `WindowKind` shapes the chrome: `Normal` is resizable/miniaturizable and joins the
  platform's tabbing group; `Preferences` drops resize/minimize and never tabs (macOS
  convention; other platforms map as fits).
- The window's lifetime is app-owned: it survives the page that opened it. Its content
  builds in a fresh scope disposed at close.
- Close is async everywhere: the title-bar close, a platform gesture, and
  `WindowHandle::close()` all route through the platform's confirm
  (`Event::WindowClosed` on the window's root), and day-core tears the subtree down on a
  deferred hop, never inside the native close callback. `on_close` runs after disposal.
- Closing the last primary window quits the app, taking secondary windows with it; a settings
  panel does not keep an app alive, however long it has been up. **macOS is the exception**:
  `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed` defaults to false there, an app
  with no windows keeps its menu bar live, and ⌘N reopens one. So on macOS the app stays up and
  its secondary windows stay with it; every other desktop treats the last primary as the app.
  A window's role comes from its `WindowKind` (`Preferences` ⇒ secondary).
- Probe `Cap::MultiWindow` to adapt chrome: on `Unsupported` backends the surface is a
  fullscreen cover with no native title bar or close button; content that needs a close
  affordance should carry its own (system back closes it on Android).
- Dialogs ([`docs/dialogs.md`](dialogs.md)) attach to the key window at present time, falling back to the
  primary.

## The preferences paradigm

```rust
// root(), once, before app_menu:
day::register_preferences_with(
    WindowOptions { title: tr("day-preferences").format(), size: Size::new(520.0, 640.0), ..Default::default() },
    || my_prefs_page(),
);
// anywhere (menu items get this wired automatically; toolbar gears call it directly):
day::open_preferences();
```

Registering a preferences piece enables the following, without any menu code in the app:

- **macOS**: "Settings…" + ⌘, in the App menu, directly under About, in both the default
  menu (apps that never call `app_menu`) and an installed one (the item is hoisted out of
  the model into its standard position).
- **GTK/Qt/XAML**: a Preferences item with the platform accelerator (Ctrl+comma; Qt's
  menu-role relocates it into the app menu on macOS, and macOS-gtk additionally enables the
  stock GTK app menu's *Settings…* through an `app.preferences` action). day-core injects it
  into the first (File) menu when the app didn't place a `menu_role(MenuRole::Preferences)`
  itself.
- The window opens under the singleton key `day.preferences` (`WindowKind::Preferences`);
  reopening focuses. On cover-tier backends `open_preferences` presents the same piece
  fullscreen; mobile apps typically keep their in-nav settings route as the visible entry
  point and gate on `Cap::MultiWindow` (Day-Matrix's `settings::show()` is the pattern).

`pieces/day-piece-settings` supplies the shared theme/language rows most preferences
surfaces need: `appearance_picker(key)` (Light/Dark/System, id `theme-picker`, gated on
`Cap::Appearance`), `language_picker(key, res::locales::ALL)` (System + autonyms, id
`language-picker`), `settings_sections(..)`, and `apply_startup(theme_key, locale_key)`,
which applies persisted overrides at boot with the **env-wins rule**: `DAY_THEME` /
`DAY_LOCALE` launches keep their forced values regardless of persistence (CI variant loops
stay deterministic), while live picker changes always apply.

## New Window + the macOS Window menu

`day::register_new_window(|| shell())` names the builder behind `menu_role(MenuRole::NewWindow)`
(File ▸ New Window, ⌘N/Ctrl+N; lowers disabled when unregistered) and the macOS tab-bar "+"
(`newWindowForTab:`). Each call opens an independent `Normal` window, and mark secondary shells'
routed navs `.local()` so `navigate()` stays unambiguous (the showcase's `window_root(primary)`
is the pattern; so is the scaffold's `window_shell(primary)`).

Because the builder runs again per window, whatever state that shell reaches for decides whether
the windows are independent; a `thread_local!` gives all of them one selection.
[docs/state.md](state.md) covers this: `T::scoped(…)` for per-window state, `T::ambient()`
to read it back anywhere below, and `T::focused()` for the app-wide menu bar, whose items belong
to no window and have to resolve the front one when they run. The same shell should call
`day::window_title` (above), so the windows it builds are distinguishable everywhere the system
lists them.

> [!NOTE]
> A live retitle reaches AppKit, GTK, Qt, XAML, UIKit and Android, primary window included.
> `day-arkui` takes the trait's default, so an OpenHarmony window keeps the title it was opened
> with; the inherited launch title makes that correct rather than blank, but it does not follow
> content yet.

On macOS, day-appkit also auto-installs the standard **Window menu** (Minimize ⌘M, Zoom,
Bring All to Front) registered as `NSApp.windowsMenu`, so AppKit appends the open-window
list and, while automatic tabbing is live, the tab commands (Show Next/Previous Tab,
Merge All Windows). `Normal` Day windows share the `day.normal` tabbing identifier and
group as native tabs per the system "prefer tabs" setting. When no new-window builder is
registered, automatic tabbing is turned off entirely, so there is no tab bar and the menu carries no tab
commands. An
app that places `MenuRole::Minimize` in its own model owns window management and skips the
auto menu.

## The debug title tag

A **debug** build appends `(<version>/<toolkit>[/<script>])` to every window title it sets
(the primary window's, each secondary window's, and every `WindowHandle::set_title`):

```
Day Showcase (1.1.0/gtk/walkthrough.yaml)
Day News (0.1.0/appkit)
```

With several apps, several toolkits and a scripted run open at once, the title bar is the only
place that says which window is which. Release builds get none of it: `day_core::debug_title_tag`
returns `None` outside `debug_assertions`, so the decoration can never ship.

The version and script name arrive as `DAY_APP_VERSION` and `DAY_SCRIPT`, which `day launch` sets
from the project manifest and the `--script` arguments ([docs/environment.md](environment.md)). Run the binary
another way and the tag carries only what it knows: `(gtk)`. Apps do nothing: **do not** put the
toolkit in your own title, or it will be there twice.

The join follows two rules. An **empty** title stays empty, so a window the app left
untitled does not grow a bar of build metadata. And an already-tagged title is left alone, since
the same window can be retitled many times.

The tag is on the window title only. The macOS App menu, the About panel and the process name
read the app's *name*, so `launch_with` pins `WindowOptions::app_name` to the undecorated title
before tagging; an app that sets only `title` still shows "Day News" in its App menu.

## dayscript

```yaml
- menu: { key: day-preferences }                       # invoke a menu action (menus.md)
- wait_for: { id: prefs-title }                        # ids are tree-global — no window scoping
- screenshot: { name: prefs, window: day.preferences } # capture a window by its open key
- close_window: { window: day.preferences }            # async confirm → teardown, like the title bar
```

`screenshot.window` resolves the key through the registry; on the cover tier it captures the
primary window, whose fullscreen cover is the content, so the same pixels come back with no
special case. (XAML
currently also answers the primary for per-window captures, a noted follow-up.)

## The Toolkit duties (backends)

`Toolkit::open_window(id, options, kind) -> WindowOpenReply<Handle>` creates and shows the
native window, wires its events to `id` (`WindowResized` in content points, `WindowClosed`
after the platform committed the close, `WindowFocused` on key changes), and answers the
content container handle, the same contract as `ready`'s root.

**`WindowResized` must carry `id`, not the primary's node.** It is what re-buckets that window's
size class ([docs/size-classes.md](size-classes.md)), so a backend that reports every window's
geometry against the primary re-lays-out the wrong window, which is what day-uikit's holder view
did, invisibly, until iPadOS made two windows at two sizes an ordinary thing. day-core relayouts
*and* re-buckets on receipt, so a secondary window dragged from narrow to wide re-presents its
navigation exactly as the primary does. Backends whose window
creation is asynchronous (a scene, an activity, an ability) answer `Pending` and complete
later through `day_core::finish_window_open(id, raw, size)`, the type-erased `RawHandle`
adoption path list cells use; day-core parks the record (build deferred) and a close before
completion cancels it (`finish_window_open` answers `false`; the backend drops its window).
`close_window`/`focus_window`/`set_window_title`/`snapshot_window_of` round out the duties;
day-core releases the content handle after teardown, which is each backend's signal to
destroy the native window (Qt/XAML defer destruction to exactly this point so child-widget
releases stay sound).

| Backend | Tier | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| AppKit | Native | per-window `NSWindow` + delegate (retained; windows are not released-when-closed); tabbing groups; Window menu |
| GTK | Native | additional `AdwApplicationWindow`s on the shared `GtkApplication`; app-level active-state debounced across windows |
| Qt | Native | shim `DayWindow` carrying its node id; explicit quit policy (`quitOnLastWindowClosed(false)`) |
| XAML | Native (CI-verified) | second Win32 host + its own `DesktopWindowXamlSource` island; accelerators in secondary islands are a noted v1 limit |
| iOS | Native on iPad (`UIScene` request/connect; the whole backend runs the scene lifecycle) | iPhone answers Unsupported → cover; iPad runtime check pends a `day launch` device flag |
| Android | Native | document-style `DayWindowActivity` per window (own recents entry; split-screen/freeform); `Preferences` → cover |
| HarmonyOS | Native (when the ArkTS host registers the launchers) | multiton `DayWindowAbility` per window; `Preferences` → cover. Pre-existing backend quirk: presented covers pass asserts and receive taps but device captures show the page beneath (affects the cover piece identically — follow-up) |
| web | Unsupported → cover fallback | a second browser window cannot share the wasm instance |
| mock | Native | recorded windows + synthesized confirms; the e2e suite that pins the window duties |
