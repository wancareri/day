# Battery (headless capability crate)

> **Status: implemented** as `day-part-battery` (in `parts/`, the headless counterpart of
> `pieces/`). It's a **headless** day-ecosystem crate (no UI Piece): a shared cross-platform API for
> reading the device battery through each platform's native API. Any Rust code can depend on it and
> call `day_part_battery::status()`. Verified on macOS (real battery), the iOS simulator, and the
> Android emulator; HarmonyOS cross-compiles + links against the native `libohbattery_info.so`.

## Authoring

```rust
if let Some(b) = day_part_battery::status() {
    println!("{:?} · {}%", b.state, b.percent().unwrap_or(0));
}
```

`status() -> Option<BatteryStatus>` returns `None` where there's no battery API (or no battery).
`BatteryStatus { level: Option<f32>, state: BatteryState }`; `level` is `0.0..=1.0` (`percent()` gives
`0..=100`); `BatteryState` is `Charging | Discharging | Full | NotCharging | Unknown`.

There are no cargo features; platform selection is purely `#[cfg(target_os)]`, because a battery is
an OS concern rather than a toolkit one. `parts/day-part-battery/examples/battery.rs` is a plain
`main` that uses it with no Day framework at all.

## Per-platform native realization

| OS | API | dependency |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | IOKit `IOPowerSources` (CoreFoundation) | `core-foundation`, IOKit framework |
| iOS | `UIDevice.batteryLevel` / `batteryState` | `objc2-ui-kit` |
| Windows | `GetSystemPowerStatus` | raw FFI (kernel32) |
| Linux | `/sys/class/power_supply` | std only |
| HarmonyOS | native `OH_BatteryInfo_GetCapacity` / `GetPluggedType` (`libohbattery_info.so`) | raw FFI (BasicServicesKit) |
| Android | `BatteryManager` via the inline Java arm in `src/android.rs` | `day-android` + `day-bridge` ([bridge.md](bridge.md)) |

iOS reads on the main thread (`UIDevice` is `MainThreadOnly`); off it, `status()` returns `None`. The
simulator has no battery, so you get `level: None, state: Unknown` (the API path still runs).

HarmonyOS is `target_os = "linux"` but sandboxes `/sys` away, so it's gated on `target_env = "ohos"`
and uses the native BasicServicesKit C API instead. That's pure FFI: it needs neither a permission
nor the Day runtime (unlike Android). The native API exposes capacity + plugged type but no explicit
charge state, so the state is inferred from whether external power is connected. The showcase's
Device & sensors page shows a live readout ([docs/harmonyos.md](harmonyos.md)).

## What it shows about the extension system

This is the first headless external crate: it has no UI Piece and registers nothing into any
backend's `RENDERERS` slice. It demonstrates that the standalone-piece backend-contribution
mechanism (see [extending.md](extending.md)) already accommodates headless capability crates:
`day-part-battery` contributes an Android implementation exactly like the UI pieces, but registers
no renderer; the staging is independent of rendering. On Android the crate rides on the Day runtime
(it uses day-android's cached JVM + `DayBridge.ctx`); on every other platform it is fully
day-independent.

The Android half is a **daybridge** arm ([bridge.md](bridge.md)): the Java that reads
`BatteryManager` lives inline in `parts/day-part-battery/src/android.rs`, beside the declaration it
implements, and `day build` stages it into the app's Gradle build. It replaced a checked-in
`DayBattery.java`, a `[package.metadata.day.android] java = [...]` table, and a packed-`i64` wire
format that was written twice and kept in agreement by comment. [day-part-speech](https://github.com/daybrite/day-part-speech) is the
fuller demonstration, with six languages in one file, in a separate repository.
