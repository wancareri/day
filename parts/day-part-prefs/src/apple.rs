// macOS + iOS (one shared file): NSUserDefaults.standard — the system's per-application preferences
// store (a plist under ~/Library/Preferences on macOS, the app container on iOS). It is
// toolkit-independent (no NSApplication / UIApplication, run loop, or window needed), so this works
// in day-qt binaries and plain `cargo test` processes just as well as under day-appkit / day-uikit.
// objc2 Foundation FFI; no Day runtime, no Java shim.
//
// `setObject:forKey:` writes synchronously to the in-memory store, which the system then flushes
// to disk on its OWN schedule — so every write here is followed by `synchronize`, which hands it
// to the preferences daemon now. That is as far as an app can push it: the daemon still writes
// the plist when it chooses, and on the simulator that was measured to be well after a scripted
// run had ended (three writes to one key, the plist held the first). What survives a plain
// relaunch is the daemon's copy, which is current; what loses the late writes is a REINSTALL of
// the app, which migrates its container and rereads the stale plist. That cost Day-Trader's iOS
// walkthrough matrix twice: once before `synchronize` was here at all, and once more because
// `day launch` reinstalled the app for every locale variant — the CLI now installs a build once
// per simulator and relaunches it. A preferences write is rare, small, and made because the
// user asked for it; the daemon round-trip is the right trade even so.
//
// Only `setObject:forKey:` is `unsafe` in objc2 (the value must be a property-list type) — we
// always pass a real NSString, which is correct.
