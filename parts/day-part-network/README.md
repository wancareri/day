# day-part-network

Is the device online? Ask the platform, not a ping.

This crate reports connectivity through each platform's native API — online or offline,
and the kind of connection (Wi-Fi, cellular, wired) where the platform reports one. Handy
for deciding when to sync, when to queue, and when to show that little offline banner.

Parts are Day's small capability crates: no UI, just a plain Rust API over something the
platform already provides. This one works in any Rust program — you don't need a Day app
around it.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.

New to Day? Start at [daybrite.dev](https://daybrite.dev), or browse the
