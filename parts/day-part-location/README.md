# day-part-location

Where the device is — once, or as a live stream — through the platform's own location service.

Ask for a single fix or subscribe to updates and stop them by dropping the handle. Every field
the platform declined to measure comes back as `None` rather than a plausible-looking zero, so
"we don't know the altitude" never reads as "sea level".

Parts are Day's small capability crates: no UI, just a plain Rust API over something the
platform already provides. This one works in any Rust program — you don't need a Day app
around it.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
