# day-part-permissions

Ask the OS for the camera, the microphone, location, notifications, photos, or motion — the
way each OS wants to be asked.

Six portable permissions cover what most apps need, and a per-platform escape hatch reaches
anything else. Before you ask, you can find out what asking would even do: whether the
platform gates this capability at all, whether a prompt would appear, and whether the answer
is already final so you should send the user to Settings instead.

Parts are Day's small capability crates: no UI, just a plain Rust API over something the
platform already provides. This one works in any Rust program — you don't need a Day app
around it.

## Part of Day

This crate is one piece of [Day](https://daybrite.dev), a Rust framework for building apps
out of each platform's own widgets — AppKit, UIKit, Android's Material widgets, GTK 4, Qt 6,
XAML, and ArkUI — from one codebase. When you write `button("Save")`, macOS shows an
`NSButton` and Android shows a Material button. The framework also ships the tooling around
the app: the `day` CLI, a VS Code extension, GitHub CI workflows, localization,
accessibility, and dayscript automation.
